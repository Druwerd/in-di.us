She established herself as a founding member and front woman of Destiny's Child and later developed into an iconic solo artist, actress, philanthropist and businesswoman. \n\nThe journey to superstardom began when Destiny's Child was formed in Houston, Texas in 1990. Beyoncé was only 9 years old. Destiny’s Child went on to become the top-selling female recording group of all-time. \n\nIn 2001, Beyoncé became the first African-American woman and the second woman ever to take home the ASCAP PopSongwriter of the Year Award. She made chart history in 2003 when she became the first artist in 20 years, and the first female recording artist ever, to simultaneously reach #1 in the U.S and the U.K with both her debut solo album Dangerously In Love and single \"Crazy In Love\", a feat accomplished by a mere handful of artists -- including the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Rod Stewart, and Men At Work. Beyoncé toured America for the first time as a solo artist in 2004 in support of her #1 multi-platinum debut solo album, Dangerously In Love which earned her five Grammy Awards that year including Best Contemporary R&B Album and Best R&B Song for \"Crazy In Love\" featuring Jay-Z. With her five-in-one-year Grammy win, Beyoncé tied the record for the most Grammy’s to be won in a single year by a female artist. \n\nOn September 4, 2006 (September 5 in the U.S.), Beyoncé released her second solo album B'DAY to coincide with her 25th birthday. B'DAY closed out 2006 as one of the year's most successful albums, entering the Billboard Top 200 best-selling albums chart at #1 and achieving 2006's highest first week's sales of any female recording act, group or solo. \n\nOn February 11, 2007, B'DAY won the Grammy for Best Contemporary R&B Album, resulting in Beyoncé's 10th Grammy win overall and 7th win as a solo artist. In November of that year, the American Music Awards honored Beyoncé with the International Artist Award making her the first woman in AMA history and sixth artist overall to be recognized with the prestigious award. In December of 2007, Beyoncé received two more Grammy nominations for chart-topping singles from B’DAY: Record of the Year for \"Irreplaceable\" and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \"Beautiful Liar,\" her superstar duet with Shakira. \"Beautiful Liar\" set the all-time record for the biggest chart jump in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 bulleting upward an unprecedented 91 slots (#94* to #3*) in a single week. \n\nIn 2007, Beyoncé embarked on the tour of the year, \"The Beyoncé Experience\" which showcased the international music and film star, along with her sizzling all-female band,\"The SUGAMAMA'S\" performing musical hits, classics, and surprises in an innovative and high-tech concert environment. November 2007 saw the release of The Beyoncé Experience LIVE!, a deluxe DVD capturing all the visual thrills and musical excitement of her spectacular world concert tour. Recorded on September 2, 2007 during Beyoncé's performance at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Beyoncé Experience LIVE! DVD contains Beyoncé's full concert performance and features a cameo from Jay-Z and the historic reunion of R&B/pop super group Destiny's Child. The Beyoncé Experience LIVE! has been certified platinum by the RIAA. \n\nNovember 18, 2008 marked the release date for the most anticipated album of the year, I AM…SASHA FIERCE. The two-disc set was a musical showcase for Beyoncé as never seen nor heard before from the artist. Each of the discs revealed a distinctly different side of her personality, character and sensibility; a forum for the yin-and-yang of her developing artistry. “I AM” displayed the intimate, heartfelt ballads while “SASHA FIERCE” boldly gave voice to Beyoncé’s up-tempo, dance-oriented other side. It was the most-talked about album of 2009, with the video for the track, “Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It),” becoming the most-watched and most mimicked around the globe. \n\nBeyoncé started the year 2010 with historic wins at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. Coming into the awards ceremony as the most nominated artist of the year with ten nominations, most from her worldwide #1 album, I AM…SASHA FIERCE, Beyoncé took home six Grammy’s®, setting a record for the female artist with the most wins in one single year. She has now earned 16 Grammy’s overall. \n\nHer historic six wins include: Song of the Year “Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)”, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance “Halo”, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance “Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It),” Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance “At Last”, Best R&B Song “Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)”, Best Contemporary R&B Album I AM…SASHA FIERCE. The win for “At Last” honored her work on the Cadillac Records soundtrack for her rendition of the Etta James hit which was seen by a worldwide audience in 2009 on Inauguration night, when she performed for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at their request. \n\nThe “I AM…” World Tour in support of the critically acclaimed album opened in Canada in March 2009 and took Beyoncé to over 100 cities around the world. She performed to sold-out crowds on every continent, including her biggest live solo concert audience ever in Sặo Paulo, Brazil, where 60,000 fans attended the show on February 6, 2010 at Morumbi Stadium. Billboard Magazine named the “I AM” World Tour the #1 concert attraction of 2009. Billboard also named Beyoncé Woman of the Year in October 2009 and Top Female Artist of the Decade in December 2009. \n\nAt the end of the North American leg of the tour in August 2009, Beyoncé performed four sold-out nights at Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas. She re-worked and re-imagined her arena show as “I AM…YOURS An Intimate Performance At Wynn Las Vegas,” to fit the smaller, more intimate 1500 seat theater. The show was released as a concert DVD on November 23, 2009 featuring a biographical story telling woven between many songs and exclusive behind-the-scenes footage. On Thanksgiving Night, the ABC television network aired a one-hour special of the live Vegas show. The I AM…WORLD TOUR , directed by Beyoncé for her own Parkwood Entertainment, debuted exclusively on ABC television as a 90-minute Thanksgiving Day primetime special. The DVD was released on November 26, 2010. \n\nBeyoncé took most of 2010 off after the tremendous success of all things I AM…, the album, the tour, the TV special and the DVD. She traveled around the world and listened to different influences that inspired her latest album, 4, released on June 28, 2011. Two days before the album’s release Beyoncé made her historic debut on The Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury, performing for a crowd of 200,000. \n\nThe critically acclaimed 4 is a shape-shifting piece of musical work for Beyoncé . Opening with three platinum-plated ballads to mid-tempos, 4 sets out its vision as a radical sidestep from the era-defining club and pop hits of Destiny's Child. For the first half of the album, before she jumps off into the street-smart 90s NewJack bounce of \"Party\", a collaboration with Kanye West and Andre 3000, you might even call it her rock record. Touring the world along with her husband, Jay-Z and his entourage in 2010 had opened her up to the possibilities of new genres and the magnitude of the festival experience. She had started looking beyond stadiums, watching Linkin Park and Muse and Rage Against The Machine whip up their adoring fans in different ways than pop music intuits. She liked what she saw. Beyoncé started thinking about the possibility of re-writing her place in musical history. 4is bold, experimental and showcases Beyoncé’s formidable, flawless voice to perfection on some impressive ballads, including “1+1,” “I Care,” and “I Was Here.” The bolder side of 4 include “Countdown,” “Love On Top,” and the album’s debut single, “Run The World (Girls).” \n\nIn August 2011, Beyoncé performed the album 4 to an intimate audience over four nights at New York’s famed Roseland Ballroom. The “Live At Roseland” DVD, also directed by Beyoncé, was released on November 21, 2011.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152782158340601","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/563647_10152782158340601_1697699894_n.jpg","offset_y":61,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Houston, TX","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":47124927,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/beyonce","name":"Beyoncé","record_label":"Columbia Records","talking_about_count":925128,"username":"beyonce","website":"http://www.beyonceonline.com http://www.beyonce.com http://www.beyonceparfums.com ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Avril Lavigne","id":"5413509299","info":{"id":"5413509299","about":"smarturl.it/AvrilHTNGU","app_id":"0","band_members":"Avril Lavigne","bio":"Avril Lavigne is a girl who knows what she wants. And when it came to writing her eagerly awaited third album, The Best Damn Thing, she had one very clear goal in mind: To make it fun. While touring in 2004 for her last album, Under My Skin, which sold more than 8 million copies worldwide, the Canadian-born punk-pop dynamo found that her favorite songs to play were the faster, more up-tempo songs—so she resolved to make a record that captured the kind of high-spirited, full-throttle energy that she loved to unleash on-stage. \nThe Best Damn Thing is brimming with gutsy guitar riffs, instantaneously catchy sing-along party-starting choruses, power pop punk, and rebellious rock ’n’ roll attitude. It’s a marked departure from the darker, more introspective tone of Under My Skin—and on tracks such as the defiant, riotous, kiss-off-to-a-cheating-boyfriend “Everything Back But You,” Avril took pleasure in creating scenarios for her lyrics that weren’t, as she says, “straight out of my diary.” The result is a collection of songs that reveal just how far she’s evolved as a songwriter and singer, from the sassy, empowering “I Can Do Better” (one of Avril’s personal favorites) to the irrepressible first single “Girlfriend”—which unexpectedly combines a hip-hop beat with beefy power chords, hand-claps, and a chanted girl-group-style chorus with a punk rock twist—to the emotional ballad “Keep Holding On,” which she wrote at the request of 20th Century Fox for the studio’s fantasy/adventure film Eragon.\nAs an artist with a keen and well-trained ear for powerful, magnetic pop melodies, Avril was intensely involved in every aspect of The Best Damn Thing’s creation: From being fiercely independent while writing her own songs (“I didn’t have an A&R guy on this record,” she emphasizes. “I knew exactly how I wanted it to sound”), to choosing her producers and musical collaborators, to obsessively going back and tweaking guitar tones and drumbeats in the studio, she worked hard to ensure that it would be her best record yet. \nThe album features the production skills of Butch Walker (who has also produced The Donnas, American Hi-Fi, and Avril’s second album, Under My Skin), Dr. Luke (Pink, Lady Sovereign), Rob Cavallo (Green Day, My Chemical Romance, Goo Goo Dolls), and her husband Deryck Whibley (from Sum 41). The process turned out to be a blast: “I didn’t know making a record could be so fun,” she says. She was eager to work with her good friend Butch again, as she says, “What’s great about Butch is that he’s a talented artist as well as being an incredible producer.” And about collaborating with Dr. Luke, she adds, “Luke and I had a really good connection and chemistry.” The relaxed atmosphere in the studio comes across in the songs themselves—Avril’s laughter rings out in “I Can Do Better,” and in “Girlfriend” you can hear her, she says, “playing a beer bottle” (by blowing into it) in the last few choruses. \nFour of the songs on The Best Damn Thing—“Innocence,” “Hot, “One of Those Girls,” and “Contagious”—were co-written with Avril’s former bandmate Evan Taubenfeld. “Evan is one of my best friends in the world,” she says, affectionately. “He’s been with me since day one”. \nOf course, all of the spiky, buoyant energy that drives the album will come to life in the live show that Avril is planning for her tour later this year—she has assembled a new band, and is even bringing along two dancers (“I’m doing choreographed dancing for the first time ever,” she grins. “It’s going to be such a blast”).\nA great deal has happened in Avril Lavigne’s life since she released her debut album, Let Go, in 2002, when she was 17 years old. That album snagged 8 Grammy nominations and four Juno Awards (including Album of the Year and New Artist of the Year), spawned the anthemic hit singles “Complicated,” “Sk8ter Boy,” and “I’m With You,” and sold more than 16 million copies world-wide. Under My Skin cemented the Napanee, Ontario native’s superstardom, entering U.S., Canadian, and U.K. charts at #1, unleashing smash singles “Don’t Tell Me” and “My Happy Ending,” and collecting three more Juno Awards along the way. \nIn 2006, Avril married Sum 41’s Deryck Whibley and branched out into acting, appearing in Richard Linklater’s Fast Food Nation and lending her voice to Dreamworks’ animated film Over the Hedge. \n\tShe may be a bit more sophisticated these days, but she’s still peerless, and still fearless. The Best Damn Thing is Avril Lavigne at a new stage in her life; she’s passed through the shadows of teen angst and emerged in a spotlight, ready to have fun and rock out and yes, even dance. It is, just as she intended, the best damn thing she’s ever done.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":1,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151526830804300","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/603622_10151526830804300_1479651655_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":40},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Napanee, Ontario, Canada","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":42199288,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/avrillavigne","location":{"street":"","zip":"","latitude":-34.65104,"longitude":-58.39552},"name":"Avril Lavigne","record_label":"Epic Records","talking_about_count":810018,"username":"avrillavigne","website":"http://www.avrillavigne.com/ smarturl.it/AvrilHTNGU","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Usher","id":"6564142497","info":{"id":"6564142497","about":"Get Looking4Myself here: http://j.mp/UsherMusic","app_id":"0","band_members":"Usher Raymond","bio":"Born in Chattanooga on October 14, 1978, Usher Raymond was raised by his single mother (and manager) Jonnetta Patton, who moved him and his younger brother to Atlanta when Usher was 12.  Mom brought up her sons within the foundations of faith and family afforded by St. Elmo’s Missionary Baptist Church, for which she served as choir director.  As early as junior high school, Usher began entering local talent shows.  He was performing at a “Star Search” competition at age 13 when he was spotted by an A&R rep from LaFace who arranged an audition with L.A. Reid.  A record contract soon followed.  “I have been building my career since I was a little boy,” Usher explains, “because singing had always been what I wanted to do.  At first I thought about playing [professional] football, then I wanted to play basketball, but in the end it was all about the music.  It’s my biggest passion and my biggest joy.”\n\nUsher was one month shy of his 15th birthday when his modest debut LaFace single made the R&B chart in late-’93, “Call Me a Mack,” from the movie soundtrack of John Singleton’s Poetic Justice.  One year later, Usher, his self-titled debut album arrived, co-executive produced by Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs.  It rose to #25 on the R&B chart on the strength of three singles: “Can U Get Wit It,” “Think Of You” (top 10, written and produced by label mate Donell Jones, with a rap by Biz Markie), and “The Many Ways” (with Al B.

Yet nine albums into her recording career, Shakira is well worthy of both accolades - and many more.\n\nJust look at the numbers. Shakira’s debut album as a 14-year-old, Magia, might have shifted only 1,200 copies in her native Colombia, but the eight albums she’s made since have sold a combined total of more than 70 million records. She saw her 2006 hit, Hips Don’t Lie, reach number one in an incredible 55 countries. The video for Waka Waka, Shakira’s official anthem for the 2010 World Cup has been viewed online well over 500 million times (making it one of YouTube’s most-watched videos ever). Plus, she’s won countless major awards and gathered vast armies of online fans, with 50 million on Facebook and 16 million on Twitter. And those fans are not just virtual, more than 2 million of them turned out to watch Shakira’s stunning Sun Comes Out world tour in 2010/11.\n\nBut it goes beyond the numbers too. Where so many choose to play it safe, Shakira is a gloriously adventurous and unpredictable pop star who can comfortably straddle genres, inspired by an insatiable passion for music that takes in everything from Leonard Cohen to AC/DC, Mercedes Sosa to Skrillex. She’s made rock records and dance records, romantic records and merengue records, all successful and all held together by the common thread of that powerful voice and that confidence to take risks and explore new directions.\n\nShakira is also a pop star with both a brain and a conscience. Her compassionate side is most obvious in the remarkable work of her Pies Descalzos (Barefoot) Foundation, which she started at the age of 18 and which has now opened its sixth school. The foundation currently provides education and nutrition to over six thousand impoverished children in Colombia and is expanding its work to other countries, including newly launched projects in Haiti and South Africa.\n\nShakira has also become a leading advocate for Education and Early Childhood Development, proving herself to be as adept at making compelling speeches to world leaders or to the students at Oxford University as she is performing to tens of thousands of fans at her shows. She is a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador and, in October 2011, President Obama appointed her to the President¹s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics.\n\nNow, in Spring 2012, with her star truly shining as brightly as it ever has, Shakira finds herself back in one of her favourite places: the recording studio. It’s not yet clear what direction that tenth album will take or what surprises it will deliver. But one thing is for sure, when it emerges, you can bet your last dime it’ll be worth hearing. \n\n///////\n\nSer “única” y “excepcional” son palabras muy fáciles de usar pero es mucho más complicado “ser” estos adjetivos. Con nueve álbumes en su carrera musical, sí que se pueden usar estas palabras al momento de definir a Shakira - incluso podríamos utilizar muchas más.\n\nLos números hablan por si solos. Shakira hizo su debut musical a los 14 años con “Magia”, un álbum que vendió 1,200 copias en Colombia, pero los ocho álbumes que le siguieron ya suman más de 70 millones de copias vendidas. Su éxito, “Hips Don’t Lie”, llegó a ser número uno en 55 países. El vídeo de “Waka Waka”, la canción oficial de la Copa Mundial 2010, ha superado las 500 millones de reproducciones (colocándolo como uno de los vídeos más vistos de la historia de YouTube). Igualmente, Shakira ha ganado incontables premios internacionales y ha reclutado una numerosa base en las redes sociales con más de 50 millones de seguidores en Facebook y 16 millones en Twitter. Y estos amigos no solamente son virtuales ya que más de 2 millones de ellos asistieron a la última gira de Shakira, “Sale El Sol”.\n\nShakira va más allá de los números. Mientras muchos deciden no asumir riesgos, Shakira es una estrella impredecible y aventurera que sabe navegar entre géneros musicales, inspirada por una pasión musical que va de Leonard Cohen a AC/DC, de Mercedes Sosa a Skrillex. Shakira ha publicado álbumes rock y dance, románticos y con ritmos de merengue, todos marcados por el éxito y unidos por el denominador común de su poderosa voz y la confianza de adoptar riesgos y aventurarse en la exploración de nuevas direcciones musicales.\n\nShakira es también una estrella con cerebro y conciencia. Su lado filantrópico se entiende a la perfección con el trabajo realizado por su “Fundación Pies Descalzos” que fundó cuando tenía 18 años y que ya tiene abiertas más de seis escuelas. La Fundación ofrece educación, nutrición y salud a más de 6,000 niños en Colombia. Este modelo está empezando su expansión en nuevos territorios con proyectos en Haití y Sudáfrica.\n\nOtra palabra clave para entender el trabajo filantrópico de Shakira es “Desarrollo Infantil Temprano”. Una causa que ha defendido tanto en multitud de discursos alrededor del mundo, como hizo en la Universidad de Oxford como en sus conciertos alrededor del mundo. Shakira también es Embajadora de Buena Voluntad de Unicef y en Octubre de 2011, Obama la nombró como miembro de la Comisión en Excelencia Educacional de los Hispanos en Estados Unidos\n\nEn esta primavera Shakira ha vuelto a su lugar favorito: el estudio de grabación. Aunque por ahora se desconoce la dirección musical de su décimo álbum, hay una cosa de la que estamos seguros, el resultado final será digno de ser escuchado. \n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151659877534560","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/941283_10151659877534560_657569021_n.jpg","offset_y":15,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Barranquilla, Colombia","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":64691771,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/shakira","name":"Shakira","record_label":"Epic Records","talking_about_count":653311,"username":"shakira","website":"http://www.shakira.com http://es.shakira.com (en español) http://www.twitter.com/shakira http://www.myspace.com/shakira ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"AKON","id":"16929140023","info":{"id":"16929140023","about":"Visit www.AKON.com and follow @AKON on Instagram/Twitter!","app_id":"0","band_members":"AKON","bio":"With 40 Billboard Hot 100 songs and over 300 guest appearances with megastars such as Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani, R.

He is the first solo artist to hold both the number one and two spots simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100 charts—an achievement he attained twice. \n\nA true entrepreneur and dedicated philanthropist, Akon founded two successful record labels, Kon Live and Konvict, which launched the careers of Lady Gaga and T-Pain and started The Konfidence Foundation, which aids underserved children in Africa and the U.S. His highly anticipated Stadium LP has been slated for release in 2012.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152795218305024","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/933910_10152795218305024_395737238_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":40},"general_manager":"Johnny Wright for Wright Entertainment Group","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Atlanta, GA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":47394094,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/AKON","name":"AKON","press_contact":"Jaime Cassavechia for EJ Media Group","record_label":"Kon Live Distribution - Upfront/Konvict/SRC/Universal Republic - Konvict Entertainment ","talking_about_count":584494,"username":"AKON","website":"http://www.Akon.com http://www.Myspace.com/Akon http://www.Twitter.com/Akon","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Alicia Keys","id":"6558867050","info":{"id":"6558867050","about":"Passionate about my work, in love with my family and dedicated to spreading light.

His fusion of pop, R&B, Latin and rock rhythms has helped catapult him beyond the limitations of genres, geography and language: making him one of the decades’ biggest stars with worldwide sales of over 40 million copies, 9 platinum or multi-platinum CDs, 19 #1 Billboard Latin hits, more than any other artist in the chart’s history, and over a half dozen top 10 singles on the Billboard Top 100.\nGathered together for the very first time Enrique Iglesias - Greatest Hits is a collection of 17 songs that made him a star; songs including: “Do You Know,” “Escape,” “Bailamos” and “Rhythm Devine;” as well as former #1s “Be With You” and “Hero.” In addition Enrique Iglesias – Greatest Hits introduces two future hits, the first of which is the explosive new single, “Away.”  A mid-tempo ballad, written and produced by A-lister/ Grammy-winner Sean Garrett “Away” is a powerful plea to keep the love lights burning, articulated by Enrique’s honest and soulful vocals. Love and loss also inspire “Takin’ Back My Love,” a collaboration with multi-platinum R&B star Ciara. Produced by Red One and written by Red One, Frankie Storm and Enrique, “Takin’ Back My Love” is fired up by Euro/electro club attitude and an undercurrent of Latin flavor. \nEnrique was born in Madrid, Spain and raised in Miami. He discovered his musical talent early, but he was determined not to coast on his father’s fame. A then teenaged Enrique shopped his first demo using the name Enrique Martinez: only reverting to his true surname after signing with a small Mexican label. \nEnrique hit the ground running. His eponymous Spanish-language debut sold one million copies, and won a Grammy award, while 1997's Vivir, broke into the U.S. Top 40.\nIn 1999, Iglesias set his sights on a new market with Enrique - his first English-language album. The CD included the mega-hits \"Bailamos,” \"Be With You,\" and \"Could I Have This Kiss Forever,\" a duet with Whitney Houston. Along with going double-platinum in the US, Enrique achieved gold or platinum status in 32 countries while sold-out world tours established Iglesias as a captivating live performer. \nEnrique built upon that success with 2001’s Escape, which included the hits \"Hero\" and \"Escape,\" and sold over 10 million copies worldwide. He followed with his fourth Spanish-language album Quizás: making him one of the few artists to score a U.S. multi-platinum English-language album followed by a U.S. multi-platinum Spanish-language album. Enrique’s winning streak continued in 2003 with 7, his aptly titled seventh album, which like 2006’s Insomniac, went platinum.\nNow, with Enrique Igelsias – Greatest Hits this dynamic global superstar gives his fans a look into his past, present and future. \n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151102625408124","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/395223_10151102625408124_1271771071_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Latin/Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Miami, FL","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":31286824,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Enrique","name":"Enrique Iglesias","record_label":"Management: The Collective: Polydor, Universal Republic, Universal Latino","talking_about_count":537781,"username":"Enrique","website":"http://www.enriqueiglesias.com https://twitter.com/#!/enrique305 http://www.myspace.com/enriqueiglesias http://www.ilike.com/artist/EnriqueIgles... http://www.imeem.com/enriqueiglesias http://www.youtube.com/enriqueiglesiasplay http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6720707725 http://www.youtube.com/enriqueiglesiasplay http://pinterest.com/enriqueIglesias/ ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Demi Lovato","id":"9208539755","info":{"id":"9208539755","about":"New single \"Heart Attack\" available on iTunes - http://smarturl.it/dliTuness3 New album DEMI available NOW - http://smarturl.it/dliTunesa1","app_id":"0","bio":"New single \"Heart Attack\" now available on iTunes - http://smarturl.it/dliTuness3","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151659815484756","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/431887_10151659815484756_1716093609_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","description":"Stay Strong","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":19117421,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/DemiLovato","name":"Demi Lovato","talking_about_count":508694,"username":"DemiLovato","website":"http://twitter.com/ddlovato http://demilovatofanclub.net/ http://www.demilovato.com http://www.myspace.com/demilovato http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/unbroken/id460236967","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Queen","id":"17337462361","info":{"id":"17337462361","about":"QUEEN is Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon and they play rock n' roll.","app_id":"0","band_interests":"Rocking and Rolling","band_members":"Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon","bio":"Queen are Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon.

Now, with his fifth studio album Nothing But The Beat, Guetta builds on that breakthrough momentum and takes his decades-spanning career to a frenetic new level marked by bigger hooks and more brain-bending beats. A star- packed powerhouse showcasing today’s hottest hip-hop and R&B artists, Nothing But The Beat backs up its high-gloss pop with ingenious electronic stylings that deftly flaunt Guetta’s DJ pedigree. In a nod to the driving force behind Guetta’s crossover success, the double album (due out August 29) also offers an all-instrumental disc designed to turn new listeners on to the hypnotic sound of house music.\n\nOne of the most wildly anticipated albums of the year, Nothing But The Beat comes hot on the heels of the rush release of its first smash single, “Where Them Girls At” (featuring Flo Rida & Nicki Minaj). Already his fasting selling single to reach gold status in the USA, the dizzying and deadly catchy “Where Them Girls At” marks a one-time return to the straight-up club-anthem sensibility of Guetta’s “Sexy Bitch” (the 2009 monster hit that moved 5 million units worldwide). “When I listen to the radio in the U.S., every song sounds like ‘Sexy Bitch,’” says Guetta. “The urban dance thing has become huge. Now I have to push it because my sound has become so popular. It’s a challenge, but I like that.”\n\nFor help in blowing up those musical boundaries, Guetta assembled an A-team of collaborators sure to thrill enthusiasts from all ends of the pop spectrum. Nothing But The Beat features no fewer than 17 guest artists, from hip-hop royalty (Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, Timbaland) and game-changing rappers (Minaj, Lil Wayne) to R&B superstars (Usher, Chris Brown, Akon) and breakout pop acts (Dev, Jessie J). Rounded out by Jennifer Hudson, Flo Rida, Taio Cruz, Sia, and Guetta’s “fellow mad scientist” Will.I.Am., that roster was carefully culled to guarantee a filler-free album destined to deliver hit after hit. “I produced about 40 songs to get these 13 records together,” Guetta explains. “I wanted every song to be huge, phenomenal.”\n\nNot only boasting massive pop appeal, Nothing But The Beat bears a broad, adventurous scope of sound that reaffirms Guetta’s role as a pioneer of the electronica/urban music hybrid. To start, the album blasts off with the dancefloor- ruling trinity of “Where Them Girls At,” “Little Bad Girl,” and “Turn Me On,” a triple threat that quickly proves Nothing But The Beat to be a high-energy hit machine. Riding off the feel-good frenzy of “Where Them Girls At,” “Little Bad Girl” pairs\n\nLudacris’s masterfully bombastic flow with the smooth, sexed-up vocals of singer/rapper Taio Cruz—all while repurposing classic house-music elements (lush synth loops, crisp beats) into a radio-ready knockout. On the glorious and gut-punching “Turn Me On,” meanwhile, Guetta grants Nicki Minaj her stunning debut as a full-fledged songbird. “Everyone knows she’s the best female rapper right now,” says Guetta. “I wanted to take her somewhere she’s never been.” The track brilliantly contrasts Minaj’s trademark madcap rapping with disarmingly tender vocal work, complementing her persona-switching performance with a slick barrage of erratic beats and spaced-out effects.\n\nEver experimental, Guetta transports his collaborators to previously unexplored sonic spaces all throughout Nothing But The Beat. On “Sweat,” for instance, Guetta remixes one of his most prized DJ records as a stark, synth-heavy electro-hop track that spotlights Snoop Dogg’s strikingly sleek vocals. Elsewhere on the album, guest artists match Guetta’s ingenuity with their own brand of beamed-in-from-another-dimension whimsy and weirdness. Just as “I Can Only Imagine” alternates shimmering, buoyant beats with wildly skidding synth, the track continually trades off Chris Brown’s warm melodies with the lyrical mischief- making of Lil Wayne (whom Guetta dubs “a big genius”). And on “I Just Wanna F,” Timbaland and Dev play a deliciously dirty version of the alphabet game while Guetta lays down a densely textured groove that makes this futuristic fever dream one of the album’s most irresistible moments.\n\nAt the heart of Nothing But The Beat is a selection of soul-stirring songs that reveal the spirit behind Guetta’s gorgeously crafted beats. With all the passion and power of an old-school dance anthem, “Night Of Your Life” shows off Jennifer Hudson’s heavenly voice and remarkable range. On the slow-building “Without You,” Usher opens with achingly vulnerable vocals that soon swell into a soaring, sweeping performance ultimately backed by delicate piano work. “It’s possibly the biggest track on the album,” says Guetta of “Without You.” “It’s a monster—so big, so emotional.” In a one-two punch, Guetta follows “Without You” with the equally wistful opening moments of “Nothing Really Matters”—then turns it all around and elevates the Will.I.Am-led track into an escapist party jam. “I love playing with both worlds,” says Guetta, noting the bold disparity between the “crazy electro-beat and the super-sophisticated string arrangement” on “Nothing Really Matters.” To close out Nothing But The Beat, Guetta taps into the otherworldly vocal prowess of Australian indie-pop star Sia. Ethereal yet anthemic, “Titanium” enchants the listener with trance-inducing beats and a lyrical intensity unrivaled on the pop scene today.\n\nSwitching gears for the 10-track accompanying disc, Guetta reconnects with his electro roots and primary fan base. “I didn’t want people who’ve been following me for years to feel left out,” says Guetta. “I feel like if I lose my original fans, it’s over. Without those people that inspire me, I’m just another pop producer.” From tripped-out techno to drum-driven dubstep experiments to raw and riotous dirty house, the instrumental element of Nothing But The Beat illuminates Guetta’s\nvirtuosity as a DJ—an art he continues to hone and expand even as he racks up chart-topping records. That evidence of Guetta’s remaining firmly rooted in club culture will no doubt satisfy longtime electronica devotees, while at the same time ushering a whole new audience into the dance-music underground. “Because I’m a DJ first, I wanted to use my success to introduce newer fans to what my culture is about and where my inspiration comes from,” Guetta notes.\n\nThat sizable success isn’t nearly limited to Guetta’s work as a recording artist and DJ. In addition to selling more than 5 million albums worldwide since his 2001 debut, Guetta acted as producer on the Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling” (the highest-selling digital release in music history). Along with his two Grammys (one for his remix of Madonna’s “Revolver” in 2011, the other for his remix of One Love’s “When Love Takes Over), Guetta took home the Best DJ, Best Producer, and Best-Selling French Artist prizes at the 2010 World Music Awards. And having kicked off his DJ career as a teenager in his native France, Guetta also partners with his wife Cathy on promoting duties for the legendary F*** Me I’m Famous dance parties (held in locations like Ibiza, Miami, New York, and Las Vegas since 1995). “It doesn’t matter if I make a beat that’s going to be a song on the radio, or if I make a record that’s meant to please DJs,” Guetta says of continuing to bridge the gap between electronic and pop on Nothing But The Beat. “I always just think of making people dance—that’s my first priority.”","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151327791776356","source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/547461_10151327791776356_968517881_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Paris, FR","genre":"Electro / House","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":42177370,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/DavidGuetta","name":"David Guetta","record_label":"WHAT A MUSIC / EMI","talking_about_count":482752,"username":"DavidGuetta","website":"http://www.davidguetta.com http://www.youtube.com/davidguetta http://twitter.com/davidguetta ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"One Direction","id":"121930497861753","info":{"id":"121930497861753","about":"The new single 'One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)'  out now! http://smarturl.it/1drednoseday","app_id":"0","band_members":"Louis Tomlinson\nLiam Payne\nNiall Horan\nZayn Malik\nHarry Styles\n\n• Website: http://www.onedirectionmusic.com\n\n• Mailing List: http://bit.ly/1DMailingList \n\n•Twitter: http://twitter.com/onedirection\n• @Harry_Styles  \n• @Real_Liam_Payne  \n• @Zaynmalik  \n• @Louis_Tomlinson  \n• @NiallOfficial\n\n•YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/OneDirectionVEVO\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":522127624508703,"source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/601734_522127624508703_2022094455_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":15671251,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/onedirectionmusic","name":"One Direction","record_label":"Syco","release_date":"The new album 'Take Me Home’ is out now: http://smarturl.it/takemehome1D","talking_about_count":482182,"username":"onedirectionmusic","website":"http://www.onedirectionmusic.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"One Direction!","id":"223569201011268","info":{"id":"223569201011268","about":"Follow us on Instagram - @anadsty and @doris_croatia7 :)\n\n\n\n","app_id":"0","band_members":"Zayn Malik\nLiam Payne\nLouis Tomlinson\nHarry Styles\nNiall Horan\n \nWebsite: http://www.onedirectionmusic.com/\n \nMailing List: http://bit.ly/1DMailingList \n\n- Official Twitter - \nhttp://twitter.com/onedirection\n- Official 1D Twitter  -\n• @Harry_Styles \n• @Real_Liam_Payne \n• @zaynmalik \n• @Louis_Tomlinson \n• @NiallOfficial\n\nOfficial Youtube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/onedirectionchannel\nYoutube VEVO: http://www.youtube.com/OneDirectionVEVO","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":553262551375263,"source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/625517_553262551375263_1937093249_n.jpg","offset_y":27,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop ♪","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"London, England","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":3146443,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/OneDirectionDirectionersFans","name":"One Direction!","record_label":"Modest Managment","release_date":"2010","talking_about_count":477627,"username":"OneDirectionDirectionersFans","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Chris Brown","id":"6329881653","info":{"id":"6329881653","about":"\"FINE CHINA'' AVAILABLE NOW: http://smarturl.it/FineChina?iqID=fb","app_id":"0","band_members":"Chris Brown","bio":"For Chris Brown, his fans were the ones who helped him rebound, giving him strength when he thought success may have been a thing of the past.  \n\nBrown’s fans around the world embraced him when he started releasing music on the internet, most notably the mix tapes that included his # 1 singles “Deuces” and “No BS.”  It was the reaction to these songs that convinced the trailblazing singer-dancer-actor to title his new album, F.A.M.E..  “I was surprised by all the love and support I got from all my fans when I started doing the ‘Deuces’ record and the mix tapes,” he says.  “They were getting really good reception, so I wanted to make it ‘Fans Are My Everything.’  It’s more personal to them and they can identify with that, from where I’ve been two years ago to now.  They can see the progress and the maturity and the level of music that I’m putting out.”\n\nTo this point, early F.A.M.E. selections “Deuces,” “No BS,” and “Look At Me Now” showcase an edgier version of Brown, one who was both confident in himself and unwilling to compromise.  But there was also the gorgeous, uplifting “Beautiful People.”  It’s almost as though Brown morphed into more than one artist.  “I wanted to balance it,” he says of his more confrontational output.  “When I go into making music, I don’t think of a genre or certain type of material.  It’s whatever comes out.  We might do an alternative song or a rock song.”  \n\nIndeed, Brown explores other exciting new musical directions on F.A.M.E.  The most dramatic and impressive examples of this are “Say It With Me” and “Oh My Love.”  The former incorporates an aggressive mix of dub step and house courtesy of producer Harmony, while the latter has an edgy feel, thunderous bass and drastic tempo changes, all which provide divergent platforms for Brown’s many vocal styles.\n\nBrown then goes from clubs to stadiums with “Next To You.”  The song, a duet with fellow superstar Justin Bieber, features the singers paying tribute to the special ladies in their lives.  It’s the type of optimistic, warm song that fills listeners with hope and promise about finding a perfect love.  Another new wrinkle to Brown’s approach comes on “Love The Girls,” “Bomb,” and “Wet The Bed,” three cuts that highlight Brown’s confident side, especially when it comes to women.\n\nYet F.A.M.E. contains a bevy of the type of Brown’s signature heartfelt songs that girls fall in love with (or fall in love to) and that guys can play for their women.  Case in point are: “She Ain’t You,” “Should’ve Kissed You,” and “All Back.”  “She Ain’t You” wistfully laments a love he aims to regain.  “Should’ve Kissed You” discusses not being confident enough to pursue a love you wanted and that you still regret, while “All Back” also deals with vulnerability, but from the realization that the love lost was more remarkable than you initially realized.  For Brown, showing his vulnerable side is important, particularly for his male fans.  “As a guy, we tend to shadow our emotions,” he says.  “I think we do that because we’re taught as a kid to do so.  One of the first things we’re taught from our fathers or our peers is to not be a punk, to grow up and to be a man.  It’s instilled in us that we can’t have a sensitive side that we have to put up a force field.  I just feel like everything is up on the table.  People know that I’ve messed up, so there’s no more stuff that I need to hide.  I’m just going to be me.”\n\nThus far, just being himself has led Chris Brown to astronomical success.  He first three albums – 2005’s Chris Brown, 2007’s Exclusive, 2009’s Graffiti – have sold millions of copies collectively and spawned such gold and platinum singles as “Run It!,” “Yo (Excuse Me Miss),” “With You,” and “Kiss Kiss.”  He’s won more than 25 awards (including Billboard’s Artist of the Year in 2006, three American Music Awards in 2007 including Artist of the Year and Favorite Male Artist-Pop, two People’s Choice Awards in 2009 including Favorite Male Singer) and has been nominated for 8 Grammy Awards and dozens of others.\n\nThe Virginia native is also an emerging movie star (including leading roles in 2007’s This Christmas and 2010’s Takers) and owns the successful MechanicalDummy.com blog site.  An avid artist himself, Brown wants the lifestyle site to serve as a platform for artists who aspire to excel in the technological, cultural, style and branding realms.  \n\nAs Brown works to help the next generation of artists, he also gives back to those less fortunate.  He’s been affiliated with Best Buddies, an organization that helps people with intellectual disabilities along with developing his own Symphonic Love foundation, which aims to provide support and funding for arts programs dedicated to the artistic development of children.  “If you have all this responsibility, this talent, you have to do something with it,” Brown says.  “You’ve really got to help people out because, all in all, that’s what my music is doing.”\n\nThe results are evident in Team Breezy, the name of Brown’s dedicated legion of fans.  There are Team Breezy branches throughout the United States, as well as France, Ireland and India, among other countries.  Now, with F.A.M.E., Brown has delivered an album that caters to his followers, one that serves as a thank you to his loyal fans and builds upon his sonic repertoire and signals the emergence of a star whose work endures.  “I want to showcase my talent,” Brown says.  “I think I’m underestimated in a sense, like ‘Oh yeah, he’s cool, but such and such is better.’  I’ll get certain things like that, so this album is to prove that I’m not better than anybody other than myself, my last hits.  I don’t want to just put out a couple of hits and be done with it.” \n\nAnd with F.A.M.E., Chris Brown shows that he’s better than ever.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151609842801654","source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/485184_10151609842801654_562382525_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Tappahannock, VA","influences":"Sam Cooke\nStevie Wonder\nDonnie Hathaway\nMichael Jackson\nUsher","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":30269969,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/chrisbrown","name":"Chris Brown","record_label":"RCA Records","talking_about_count":464461,"username":"chrisbrown","website":"http://www.chrisbrownworld.com/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Bob Marley","id":"117533210756","info":{"id":"117533210756","about":"www.bobmarley.com\nwww.bobmarleyshop.com\nwww.twitter.com/bobmarley\nwww.pinterest.com/bobmarley\n","app_id":"0","band_members":"Bob Marley","bio":"Bob Marley was a hero figure, in the classic mythological sense. His departure from this planet came at a point when his vision of One World, One Love -- inspired by his belief in Rastafari -- was beginning to be heard and felt. The last Bob Marley and the Wailers tour in 1980 attracted the largest audiences at that time for any musical act in Europe.\n\nBob's story is that of an archetype, which is why it continues to have such a powerful and ever-growing resonance: it embodies political repression, metaphysical and artistic insights, gangland warfare and various periods of mystical wilderness. And his audience continues to widen: to westerners Bob's apocalyptic truths prove inspirational and life-changing; in the Third World his impact goes much further. Not just among Jamaicans, but also the Hopi Indians of New Mexico and the Maoris of New Zealand, in Indonesia and India, and especially in those parts of West Africa from wihch slaves were plucked and taken to the New World, Bob is seen as a redeemer figure returning to lead this.\n\nIn the clear Jamaican sunlight you can pick out the component parts of which the myth of Bob Marley is comprised: the sadness, the love, the understanding, the Godgiven talent. Those are facts. And although it is sometimes said that there are no facts in Jamaica, there is one more thing of which we can be certain: Bob Marley never wrote a bad song. He left behind the most remarkable body of recorded work. \"The reservoir of music he has left behind is like an encyclopedia,\" says Judy Mowatt of the I-Threes. \"When you need to refer to a certain situation or crisis, there will always be a Bob Marley song that will relate to it. Bob was a musical prophet.\"\n\nThe tiny Third World country of Jamaica has produced an artist who has transcended all categories, classes, and creeds through a combination of innate modesty and profound wisdom. Bob Marley, the Natural Mystic, may yet prove to be the most significant musical artist of the twentieth century.\n\nBob Marley gave the world brilliant and evocative music; his work stretched across nearly two decades and yet still remains timeless and universal. Bob Marley & the Wailers worked their way into the very fabric of our lives.\n\n\"He's taken his place alongside James Brown and Sly Stone as a pervasive influence on R & B\", says the American critic Timothy White, author of the acclaimed Bob Marley biography CATCH A FIRE: THE LIFE OF BOB MARLEY. \"His music was pure rock, in the sense that it was a public expression of a private truth.\"\n\nIt is important to consider the roots of this legend: the first superstar from the Third World, Bob Marley was one of the most charismatic and challenging performers of our time and his music could have been created from only one source: the street culture of Jamaica.\n\nThe days of slavery are a recent folk memory on the island. They have permeated the very essence of Jamaica's culture, from the plantation of the mid-nineteenth century to the popular music of our own times.\n\nAlthough slavery was abolished in 1834, the Africans and their descendants developed their own culture with half-remembered African traditions mingled with the customs of the British.\n\nThis hybrid culture, of course, had parallels with the emerging black society in America. Jamaica, however, remained a rural community which, without the industrialisation of its northern neighbour, was more closely rooted to its African legacy.\n\nBy the start of the twentieth century that African heritage was given political expression by Marcus Garvey, a shrewd Jamaican preacher and entrepreneur who founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The organisation advocated the creation of a new black state in Africa, free from white domination. As the first step in this dream, Garvey founded the Black Star Line, a steamship company which, in popular imagination at least, was to take the black population from America and the Caribbean back to their homeland of Africa.\n\nA few years later, in 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia and took a new name, Haile Selassie, The Emperor claimed to be the 225th ruler in a line that stretched back to Menelik, the son of Solomon and Sheba.\n\nThe Marcus Garvey followers in Jamaica, consulting their New Testaments for a sign, believed Haile Selassie was the black king whom Garvey had prophesied would deliver the Negro race. It was the start of a new religion called Rastafari.\n\nFifteen years later, in Rhoden Hall to the north of Jamaica, Bob Marley was born. His mother was an eighteen-year-old black girl called Cedella Booker while his father was Captain Norval Marley, a 50-year-old white quartermaster attached to the British West Indian Regiment.\n\nThe couple married in 1944 and Robert Nesta Marley was born on February 6, 1945. Norval Marley's family, however, applied constant pressure and, although he provided financial support, the Captain seldom saw his son who grew up in the rural surroundings of St. Ann to the north of the island.\n\nFor country people in Jamaica, the capital Kingston was the city of their dreams, the land of opportunity. The reality was that Kingston had little work to offer, yet through the Fifties and Sixties, people flooded to the city. The newcomers, despite their rapid disillusion with the capital, seldom returned to the rural parishes. Instead, they squatted in the shanty towns that grew up in western Kingston, the most notorious of which was Trench town (so named because it was built over a ditch that drained the sewage of old Kingston.)\n\nBob Marley, barely into his teens, moved to Kingston in the late Fifties. Like many before them, Marley and his mother eventually settled in Trenchtown. His friends were other street youths, also impatient with their place in Jamaican society. One friend in particular was Neville O'Riley Livingston, known as Bunny, with whom Bob took his first hesitant musical steps.\n\nThe two youths were fascinated by the extraordinary music they could pick up from American radio stations. In particular there was one New Orleans station broadcasting the latest tunes by such artists as Ray Charles, Fats Domino, Curtis Mayfield and Brook Benton. Bob and Bunny also paid close attention to the black vocal groups, such as the Drifters, who were extremely popular in Jamaica.\n\nWhen Bob quit school he seemed to have but one ambition: music. Although he took a job in a welding shop, Bob spent all his free time with Bunny, perfecting their vocal abilities. They were helped by one of Trench Town's famous residents, the singer Joe Higgs who held informal lessons for aspiring vocalists in the tenement yards. It was at one of those sessions that Bob and Bunny met Peter McIntosh, another youth with big musical ambitions.\n\nIn 1962 Bob Marley auditioned for a local music entrepreneur called Leslie Kong. Impressed by the quality of Bob's vocals, Kong took the young singer into the studio to cut some tracks, the first of which, called \"Judge Not\", was released on Beverley's label. It was Marley's first record.\nThe other tunes -- including \"Terror\" and \"One Cup of Coffee\" -- received no airplay and attracted little attention. At the very least, however, they confirmed Marley's ambition to be a singer. By the following year Bob had decided the way forward was with a group. He linked up with Bunny and Peter to form The Wailing Wailers.\n\nThe new group had a mentor, a Rastafarian hand drummer called Alvin Patterson, who introduced the youths to Clement Dodd, a record producer in Kingston. In the summer of 1963 Dodd auditioned The Wailing Wailers and, pleased with the results, agreed to record the group.\n\nIt was the time of ska music, the hot new dance floor music with a pronounced back-beat. Its origins incorporated influences from Jamaica's African traditions but, more immediately, from the heady beats of New Orleans' rhythm & blues disseminated from American radio stations and the burgeoning sound systems on the streets of Kingston. Clement - Sir Coxsone - Dodd was one of the city's finest sound system men.\n\nThe Wailing Wailers released their first single, \"Simmer Down\", on the Coxsone label during the last weeks of 1963. By the following January it was number one in the Jamaican charts, a position it held for the next two months. The group -- Bob, Bunny and Peter together with Junior Braithwaite and two back-up singers, Beverly Kelso and Cherry Smith -- were big news.\n\n\"Simmer Down\" caused a sensation in Jamaica and The Wailing Wailers began recording regularly for Coxsone Dodd's Studio One Company. The groups' music also found new themes, identifying with the Rude Boy street rebels in the Kingston slums. Jamaican music had found a tough, urban stance.\n\nOver the next few years The Wailing Wailers put out some thirty sides that properly established the group.\n\nDespite their popularity, the economics of keeping the group together proved too much and the three other members -- Junior Braithwaite, Beverly Kelso and Cherry Smith -- quit. Bob's mother, Cedella, had remarried and moved to Delaware in the United States where she had saved sufficient money to send her son an air ticket. The intention was for Bob to start a new life. But before he moved to America, Bob met a young girl called Rita Anderson and, on February 10, 1966, they were married.\n\nMarley's stay in America was short-lived. He worked just enough to finance his real ambition: music. In October 1966 Bob Marley, after eight months in America, returned to Jamaica. It was a formative period in his life. The Emperor Haile Selassie had made a state visit to Jamaica in April that year. By the time Bob re-settled in Kingston the Rastafarian movement had gained new credence.\n\nMarley was increasingly drawn towards Rastafari. In 1967 Bob's music reflected his new beliefs. Gone were the Rude Boy anthems; in their place was a growing commitment to spiritual and social issues, the cornerstone of his real legacy.\n\nMarley joined up with Bunny and Peter to re-form the group, now known as The Wailers. Rita, too, had started a singing career, having a big hit with \"Pied Piper\", a cover of an English pop song. Jamaican music, however, was changing. The bouncy ska beat had been replaced by a slower, more sensual rhythm called rock steady.\n\nThe Wailers new commitment to Rastafarianism brought them into conflict with Coxsone Dodd and, determined to control their own destiny, the group formed their own record label, Wail 'N' Soul. Despite a few early successes, however, the Wailers' business naivete proved too much and the label folded in late 1967.\n\nThe group survived, however, initially as songwriters for a company associated with the American singer Johnny Nash who, the following decade, was to have an international smash with Marley's \"Stir It Up\". The Wailers also met up with Lee Perry, whose production genius had transformed recording studio techniques into an art form.\n\nThe Perry/Wailers combination resulted in some of the finest music the band ever made. Such tracks as \"Soul Rebel\", \"Duppy Conqueror\", \"400 Years\" and \"Small Axe\" were not only classics, but they defined the future direction of reggae.\n\nIn 1970 Aston 'Family Man' Barrett and his brother Carlton (bass and drums respectively) joined the Wailers. They had been the rhythm nucleus of Perry's studio band, working with the Wailers on those ground-breaking sessions. They were also unchallenged as Jamaica's hardest rhythm section, a status that was to remain undiminished during the following decade. The band's reputation was, at the start of the Seventies, an extraordinary one throughout the Caribbean. But internationally the Wailers were still unknown.\n\nIn the summer of 1971 Bob accepted an invitation from Johnny Nash to accompany him to Sweden where the American singer had taken a filmscore commission. While in Europe Bob secured a recording contract with CBS which was also, of course, Nash's company. By the spring of 1972 the entire Wailers were in London, ostensibly promoting their CBS single \"Reggae on Broadway\". Instead they found themselves stranded in Britain.\n\nAs a last throw of the dice Bob Marley walked into the Basing Street Studios of Island Records and asked to see its founder Chris Blackwell. The company, of course, had been one of the prime movers behind the rise of Jamaican music in Britain; indeed Blackwell had launched Island in Jamaica during the late fifties.\n\nBy 1962, however, Blackwell had realised that, by re-locating Island to London, he could represent all his Jamaican rivals in Britain. The company was re-born in May, 1962, selling initially to Britain's Jamaican population centered mostly in London and Birmingham.\n\nThe hot ska rhythm, however, quickly became established as a burgeoning dance floor beat with the then growing Mod culture and, in 1964, Blackwell produced a worldwide smash with 'My Boy Lollipop', a pop/ska tune by the young Jamaican singer Millie.\n\nThrough the Sixties Island had grown to become a major source of Jamaican music, from ska and rock steady to reggae. The company had also embraced white rock music, with such bands and artists as Traffic, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Cat Stevens, Free and Fairport Convention so, when Bob Marley made his first moves with Island in 1971, he was connecting with the hottest independent in the world at that time.\n\nBlackwell knew of Marley's Jamaican reputation. The group was offered a deal unique in Jamaican terms. The Wailers were advanced £4000 to make an album and, for the first time, a reggae band had access to the best recording facilities and were treated in much the same way as, say, their rock group contemporaries. Before this deal, it was considered that reggae sold only on singles and cheap compilation albums. The Wailers' first album \"Catch A Fire\" broke all the rules: it was beautifully packaged and heavily promoted. It was the start of a long climb to international fame and recognition.\n\nYears later the acclaimed reggae dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson, commenting on \"Catch A Fire\", wrote: \"A whole new style of Jamaican music has come into being. It has a different character, a different sound. . . what I can only describe as International Reggae. It incorporates elements from popular music internationally: rock and soul, blues and funk. These elements facilitated a breakthrough on the international market.\"\n\nAlthough \"Catch A Fire\" was not an immediate hit, it made a considerable impact on the media. Marley's hard dance rhythms, allied to his militant lyrical stance, came in complete contrast to the excesses of mainstream rock. Island also decided The Wailers should tour both Britain and America; again a complete novelty for a reggae band.\n\nMarley and the band came to London in April 1973, embarking on a club tour which hardened The Wailers as a live group. After three months, however, the band returned to Jamaica and Bunny, disenchanted by life on the road, refused to play the American tour. His place was taken by Joe Higgs, The Wailers' original singing teacher.\n\nThe American tour drew packed houses and even included a weekend engagement playing support to the young Bruce Springsteen. Such was the demand that an autumn tour was also arranged with seventeen dates as support to Sly & The Family Stone, then the number one band in black American music.\n\nFour shows into the tour, however, The Wailers were taken off the bill. It seems they had been too good; support bands should not detract from the main attraction. The Wailers nevertheless made their way to San Francisco where they broadcast a live concert for the pioneering rock radio station, KSAN.\n\nThe bulk of that session was finally made available in February 1991, when Island released the commemorative album, \"Talkin' Blues\".\n\nIn 1973 The Wailers also released their second Island album, \"Burnin'\", an LP that included new versions of some of the band's older songs: \"Duppy Conqueror\", for instance, \"Small Axe\" and \"Put It On\" -- together with such tracks as \"Get Up Stand Up\" and \"I Shot The Sheriff\". The latter, of course, was a massive worldwide hit for Eric Clapton the following year, even reaching number one in the U.S. singles' chart.\n\nIn 1974 Marley spent much time of his time in the studio working on the sessions that eventually provided \"Natty Dread\", an album that included such fiercely committed songs as \"Talkin' Blues\", \"No Woman No Cry\", \"So Jah Seh\", \"Revolution\", \"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\" and \"Rebel Music (3 o'clock Roadblock)\". By the start of the next year, however, Bunny and Peter had quit the group; they were later to embark on solo careers (as Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh) while the band was re-named Bob Marley & The Wailers.\n\n\"Natty Dread\" was released in February 1975 and, by the summer, the band was on the road again. Bunny and Peter's missing harmonies were replaced by the I-Threes, the female trio comprising Bob's wife Rita together with Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt. Among the concerts were two shows at the Lyceum Ballroom in London which, even now, are remembered as highlights of the decade.\n\nThe shows were recorded and the subsequent live album, together with the single \"No Woman No Cry\", both made the charts. Bob Marley & The Wailers were taking reggae into the mainstream. By November, when The Wailers returned to Jamaica to play a benefit concert with Stevie Wonder, they were obviously the country's greatest superstars.\n\n\"Rastaman Vibration\", the follow-up album in 1976, cracked the American charts. It was, for many, the clearest exposition yet of Marley's music and beliefs, including such tracks as \"Crazy Baldhead\", \"Johnny Was\", \"Who the Cap Fit\" and, perhaps most significantly of all, \"War\", the lyrics of which were taken from a speech by Emperor Haile Selassie.\n\nIts international success cemented Marley's growing political importance in Jamaica, where his firm Rastafarian stance had found a strong resonance with the ghetto youth.\n\nBy way of thanking the people of Jamaica, Marley decided on a free concert, to be held at Kingston's National Heroes Park on December 5, 1976. The idea was to emphasise the need for peace in the slums of the city, where warring factions had brought turmoil and murder.\n\nJust after the concert was announced, the government called an election for December 20. The campaign was a signal for renewed ghetto war and, on the eve of the concert, gunmen broke into Marley's house and shot him.\n\nIn the confusion the would-be assassins only wounded Marley, who was hastily taken to a safe haven in the hills surrounding Kingston. For a day he deliberated playing the concert and then, on December 5, he came on stage and played a brief set in defiance of the gunmen.\n\nIt was to be Marley's last appearance in Jamaica for nearly eighteen months. Immediately after the show he left the country and, during early 1977, lived in London where he recorded his next album, Exodus.\n\nReleased in the summer of that year, Exodus properly established the band's international status. The album remained on the UK charts for 56 straight weeks, and its three singles - \"Exodus\", \"Waiting in Vain\" and \"Jammin\" - were all massive sellers. The band also played a week of concerts at London's Rainbow Theatre; their last dates in the city during the seventies.\n\nIn 1978 the band capitalised on their chart success with \"Kaya\", an album which hit number four in the UK the week after release. That album saw Marley in a different mood; a collection of love songs and, of course, homages to the power of ganja. The album also provided two chart singles, \"Satisfy My Soul\" and the beautiful \"Is This Love\".\n\nThere were three more events in 1978, all of which were of extraordinary significance to Marley. In April, he returned to Jamaica to play the One Love Peace Concert in front of the Prime Minister Michael Manley and the Leader of the Opposition Edward Seaga.\n\nHe was then invited to the United Nations in New York to receive the organisation's Medal of Peace. At the end of the year Bob also visited Africa for the first time, going initially to Kenya and then on to Ethiopia, spiritual home of Rastafari.\n\nThe band had earlier toured Europe and America, a series of shows that provided a second live album, \"Babylon By Bus\". The Wailers also broke new ground by playing in Australia, Japan and New Zealand: truly international style reggae.\n\n\"Survival\", Bob Marley's ninth album for Island Records, was released in the summer of 1979. It included \"Zimbabwe\", a stirring anthem for the soon-to-be liberated Rhodesia, together with \"So Much Trouble In The World\", \"Ambush In The Night\" and \"Africa Unite\"; as the sleeve design, comprising the flags of the independent nations, indicated, \"Survival\" was an album of pan-African solidarity.\n\nAt the start of the following year -- a new decade -- Bob Marley & The Wailers flew to Gabon where they were to make their African debut. It was not an auspicious occasion, however, when the band discovered they were playing in front of the country's young elite. The group, nevertheless, was to make a quick return to Africa, this time at the official invitation to the government of liberated Zimbabwe to play at the country's Independence Ceremony in April, 1980. It was the greatest honour ever afforded the band, and one which underlined the Wailer's importance in the Third World.\n\nThe band's next album, \"Uprising\", was released in May 1980. It was an instant hit, with the single, \"Could You Be Loved\" a massive worldwide seller. Uprising also featured \"Coming In From the Cold\", \"Work\" and the extraordinary closing track, \"Redemption Song\".\n\nThe Wailers embarked on a major European tour, breaking festival records throughout the continent. The schedule included a 100,000-capacity crowd in Milan, the biggest show in the band's history. Bob Marley & The Wailers, quite simply, were the most important band on the road that year and the new Uprising album hit every chart in Europe. It was a period of maximum optimism and plans were being made for an American tour, in company with Stevie Wonder, that winter.\n\nAt the end of the European tour Marley and the band went to America. Bob played two shows at Madison Square Garden but, immediately afterwards, was taken seriously ill.\n\nThree years earlier, in London, Bob hurt a toe while playing football. The wound had become cancerous and was belatedly treated in Miami, yet it continued to fester. By 1980 the cancer, in its most virulent form, had begun to spread through Marley's body.\n\nHe fought the disease for eight months, taking treatment at the clinic of Dr. Joseph Issels in Bavaria. Issels' treatment was controversial and non-toxic and, for a time anyway, Bob's condition seemed to stabilise.\n\nEventually, however, the battle proved too much. At the start of May, Bob Marley left Germany for his Jamaican home, a journey he did not complete.\n\nHe died in a Miami hospital on Monday May 11, 1981.\n\nThe previous month, Marley had been awarded Jamaica's Order Of Merit, the nation's third highest honour, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the country's culture.\n\nOn Thursday May 21, 1981, the Hon. Robert Nesta Marley O.M. was given an official funeral by the people of Jamaica. Following the service - attended by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition - Marley's body was taken to his birthplace at Nine Mile, on the north of the island, where it now rests in a mausoleum. Bob Marley was 36-years-old. His legend, however, has conquered the years.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151630332225757","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/15185_10151630332225757_1445535754_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Reggae","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":43044598,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/BobMarley","name":"Bob Marley","press_contact":"webgeek@bobmarley.com","record_label":"Tuff Gong/Universal","talking_about_count":438794,"username":"BobMarley","website":"www.bobmarley.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Jennifer Lopez","id":"5170395767","info":{"id":"5170395767","about":"www.jenniferlopez.com Actress, entertainer, music artist, film & TV producer, fashion designer, entrepreneur and humanitarian, Jennifer Lopez is one of the most powerful and celebrated celebrities in entertainment.","app_id":"0","band_members":"Jennifer Lopez","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151581537030768","source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/942914_10151581537030768_1415026643_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":38},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"The Bronx, New York","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":22112030,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/jenniferlopez","name":"Jennifer Lopez","record_label":"Island Def Jam","talking_about_count":433637,"username":"jenniferlopez","website":"www.jenniferlopezonline.com www.jenniferlopez.com www.twitter.com/jlo www.myspace.com/jenniferlopez www.youtube.com/jenniferlopez","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Justin Timberlake","id":"5718732097","info":{"id":"5718732097","about":"www.justintimberlake.com -- www.twitter.com/jtimberlake  -- http://new.myspace.com/justintimberlake -- www.youtube.com/justintimberlake --  www.iTunes.com/JustinTimberlake ","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151432639167098","source":"http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/s720x720/577684_10151432639167098_348656418_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Memphis, Tennessee","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":22209126,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/justintimberlake","name":"Justin Timberlake","talking_about_count":415822,"username":"justintimberlake","website":"http://justintimberlake.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Ivete Sangalo","id":"16499888529","info":{"id":"16499888529","about":"Facebook oficial de Ivete Sangalo atualizado pela própria e pela equipe do site.

They stare at us from the covers of glossy magazines, talk to us from both the small and silver screen, interact with us through our laptops and hypnotize us with their inescapable hit singles. But too often these days, while our biggest stars may be omnipresent in our lives, we feel no genuine connection to them or their artistry.\n\nYet, hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg is different. While, he’s everywhere, all of the time—from The View to 106th & Park, Sportscenter to One Life To Live, and from commercials with Adidas to Pepsi Max—Snoop’s continuing appeal to his legions of fans stems from a true bond that they have built with him through his music. And like Bigg Snoop, the music’s been everywhere. Whether it’s a stadium stage or the screen on your mobile phone, Snoop has most likely rocked it.\nNow, as anticipation steadily climbs for his quickly approaching 11th studio album, Doggumentary, Tha Doggfather is continuing to enhance his connection with his fans through his music. Not only is Snoop utilizing his unrivaled digital presence to offer his fans inside access to the creative process behind the Doggumentary, but the album itself acts a memoir of sorts—both chronicling his journey in the game thus far and plotting where his path will lead him in the future.\nThe latest collection reflects everything that the world has come to embrace about the man born Calvin Broadus. While delivering several of the bombastic street raps that initially propelled Snoop to stardom, Doggumentary also boasts the sort of unpredictable collaborations that have made him a pop culture phenomenon.\n \nUnafraid to experiment with his established sound, the intoxicating lead single \"Wet\" sees Snoop working with the newly hot production duo The Cataracs. Together, they unite to startling effect, creating an entrancing and atmospheric club jam that has already pounced on various radio formats. Another first-time contributor to Snoop's illustrious catalogue is producer Lex Luger. The native Virginian (responsible for Rick Ross' thunderous anthems “MC Hammer” and  \"B.M.F.\") provides Tha Bigg Boss Dogg with something even more triumphant—the fittingly titled \"Platinum,\" a song that also reunites Snoop with famed crooner R. Kelly.\nFrom here, Snoop continues to roll out the blue carpet, inviting alternative heroes Gorillaz to provide the psychedelic organ thrusts to Snoop’s unusually playful flow on \"Sumthin Like This Night\". Rising sensation Wiz Khalifa stops by for the playful, self-explanatory \"This Weed Iz Mine,\"  which sees our host gleefully announce that he's taking it back to \"classic Snoop.\" Then the melancholy strings of the Kanye West produced \"Eyez Closed\" inspire a wizened D-O-Double G to both reflect and caution, \"If you taste success, make sure it's from a tall glass.\" Still the energy immediately ramps up with the surefire hit \"Boom\" featuring T-Pain. Here, Snoop announces himself the \"chief rocka\" over producer Scott Storch’s ingeniously utilized sample of Yaz’ “Situation”.\nWhile mainstream audiences will undoubtedly rapturously receive the aforementioned, Snoop spends ample time on Doggumentary rewarding his loyal core fanbase. \"My Fucn House\" is as authoritative as its title suggests, as Snoop, Jeezy and E-40 delve into the trap over Rick Rock's energetic pomp. \"We Rest N Cali\" is Snoop's unapologetic ode to California's more sinister dwellings, aided by a typically merciless Goldie Loc. \"Gangbang Rookie\" will be considered vintage Snoop as he asserts himself as, \"a Boss out here on the West\" over Jake One's rattling funk. While Jake does an impeccable job recreating West Coast G-Funk on both \"Rookie\" and the album intro \"Toyz N Da Hood,\" Snoop recruits a few other notable comrades to assist. These include Battlecat (\"The Way Life Used To Be,\" \"Wonder What It Do\"), Fredwreck (\"Peer Pressure\"), and Meech Wells (\"Take U Home.\") All mentioned succeed in conjuring definitive Snoop, whether he is shamelessly spitting game, confronting adversaries, or reflecting on his incredible career trajectory\n \nTo promote Doggumentary, Snoop has wisely conceptualized the album’s title. By aligning his social media prowess with his creative output, Snoop is \"doggumenting\" the album’s progress online. He has already launched the much discussed #PuffPuffPassTuesdays campaign, where he releases exclusive visual and audio content to his 2.5 million Twitter followers every week. Next, unprecedented access to Snoop's inner circle is granted via his frequent Ustream sessions. These afford millions of fans across the globe the opportunity to log-in and interact with Snoop live, as he streams new music. Snoop is also responsible for the prolific WestFestTV channel on YouTube, which regularly uploads candid footage of Snoop in action and a slew of viral music videos.\nSnoop Dogg's ability to stay at the forefront of popular culture and connect with his fans has resulted in unwavering relevance. While he’s a TV and movie star, the founder and coach of a hugely successful youth football league and a savvy adapter of new technology, Snoop Dogg remains Tha Doggfather of hip-hop. Incredibly, his music is as \"doggumented\" now as it was in 1992 around the launch of his timeless debut Doggystyle. In fact, a stronghold over the various social networking platforms makes him more accessible than ever. With all eyes on the skinny kingpin from Long Beach, Doggumentary is the perfect title for the man who continues to occupy thethrone as the world’s most famous rapper.\n\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151438350939807","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/s720x720/430552_10151438350939807_504948883_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Hip Hop / Rap / R&B","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Long Beach, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":25358864,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/snoopdogg","name":"Snoop Dogg","record_label":"Priority/Doggystyle ","talking_about_count":404729,"username":"snoopdogg","website":"http://SnoopDogg.com ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"P!nk","id":"5956341397","info":{"id":"5956341397","about":"Follow P!nk on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/pink : For tour info visit http://thetruthaboutlovetour.com/","app_id":"0","band_members":"P!nk","bio":"P!nk has never been afraid to speak her mind, bare her soul, and share her deepest feelings in her songs. As she casually confers, “I have no choice. It’s what I do.” Indeed, it is what P!nk does. And, her 23 million in album sales, two Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, and eight top 10 hit singles are proof that the tattooed badass with the heart of a pussycat does what she does well. Very well. But, with her fifth studio album, Funhouse (Oct. 28 via LaFace/Zomba), P!nk gets even more personal, more exposed, and more revealing.\n\n“This is my most vulnerable album to date,” says P!nk, 29, who has no problem fessing up to the fact that the split from her husband, motocross star Carey Hart, earlier this year is the subject of some songs on Funhouse. “On my first record, Can’t Take Me Home (2000), I was pissed off at a guy and that was cathartic for me. M!ssundaztood (2001) was very personal and even more cathartic. I remember talking about the song ‘Family Portrait’ in interviews and just crying. Each record got a little deeper and more cathartic than the last. In two years I will probably have worked through all of my issues.”\n\nBut, for now, one issue that P!nk is still working through is heartbreak. “Heartbreak is a Motherfucker is what I originally wanted to name the album,” laughs the singer. “But this album is not all about that. It’s not just a breakup album. There is a lot of that, but there is fun happening too and that’s why I named it Funhouse in the end.”\n\nP!nk admits that it felt as “scary” as it felt “great” to reach new depths of vulnerability on such tracks as “Please Don’t Leave Me,” a painfully honest love song disguised by upbeat, cheerful, and happy instrumentation with sing-along “da da da da”s in the background, and “I Don’t Believe You,” the heart-wrenching ballad featuring P!nk’s raw vocals over simple piano and strings. (Both songs were co-written with Max Martin.)\n\n“It’s like letting down the armor and admitting I’m human. I’m a girl. We all want to be loved and love. That’s all we want,” she explains. “‘Please Don’t Leave Me’ is also kind of funny though. It’s like, ‘Okay, I’m an asshole, but love me anyway.’ I’m trying to be better. We’re all a work in progress. And, ‘I Don’t Believe You’ is one of my favorite songs because it’s just so naked. It’s like taking a deep breathe and saying, ‘Here I am. Take me. Take your best shot.’ ‘Mean’ is a country-Aerosmith-rock song that asks, ‘How did we get so mean?’ Everything starts out so yummy. ‘Where did we lose the plot? How is it that you once were holding the door for me and now I’m slamming it in your face?’”\n\nP!nk also pulls no punches tackling the breakup issue on the first single, the infectious pop-rocker “So What,” which hit No. 1 on The Billboard Hot 100 on September 18, 2008 making it the singer’s first No. 1 solo hit song in her career. (She previously shared the top spot on the Hot 100 with Christina Aguilera, Lil’ Kim, and Mya on 2001’s “Lady Marmalade” from the Moulin Rouge soundtrack.)\n\nOn “So What,” P!nk gets real once again but this time it’s infused with her trademark humor as evidenced by such funny-honest lyrics as “I guess I just lost my husband/I don’t know where he went/So I’m gonna drink my money/I’m not gonna pay his rent.” Having her ex, Carey Hart, in the Dave Meyers-directed video diffused some of the reaction to the lyrical content. “At first I was kind of irked because everyone was like, ‘Well, wait. I thought the split was amicable and now she’s talking shit about him?! What the fuck?’ It’s hypocritical.’ But once everyone saw the video and saw that Carey was in it, it shut everybody up, which was lovely,” explains P!nk, who collaborated with Martin once again for this track. “Carey hadn’t heard the song before he did the video. That’s how much he trusts and loves me. He pretty much just rolls his eyes, throws his hands up in the air, and hugs me. He gets it. He gets me. It’s nice.”\n\nAlthough P!nk expanded her emotional and musical horizons on this new collection, the one song she is most proud of is “Crystal Ball,” an acoustic guitar ballad written with Billy Mann, who worked on such past hits as “Stupid Girls,” “Dear Mr. President,” and “I’m Not Dead,” among others. “I am proud of the songwriting, melody, and vocals on that song,” she says. “I recorded it in one take and we didn’t mix it. It just went straight to master. It was all about a vibe and not about perfection or being polished. I just love that song and I loved recording it. Me and Billy got in a room and lit some candles, had some wine, and threw up a guitar mike and two vocal mikes and just went with it.”\n\nOther revealing tracks include “It’s All Your Fault,” in which she proclaims in the lyrics “I conjure up the thought of being gone, but I’d probably even do that wrong.” While in “Glitter in the Air,” P!nk asks a lot of questions such as, “Have you ever looked fear in the face and said I just don’t care?” and “Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?” P!nk admits, “I still don’t have some of the answers to the questions I pose on this record. I’m still figuring it all out.”\n\nBut as P!nk said, Funhouse isn’t just a breakup album. “Bad Influence” (written with Billy Mann and Butch Walker) is a straight up rock chick party song that makes no apologies for wilding out with your gal pals once in a while. “I’m with the Hindus on that one,” laughs P!nk. “Pleasure for pleasure’s sake is not a guilty sin.” “Sober” is another song that has nothing to do with heartbreak. It’s a dark ditty with strings about how one wishes they could be fearless and lose their inhibitions without having a vice.\n\nThe bluesy “One Foot Wrong” is about an acid trip gone bad. “I used to be into a lot of crazy shit,” says P!nk. “Acid’s the most awful drug ever. Don’t take it. But, that song is also about losing control and how easy it is to lose the plot in life and teeter on the edge.” Meanwhile, “Ave Mary A” takes on the world and social issues, asking for help in letting go from “the chaos around me” and dealing with a “world gone mad.”\n\nAs for the title, Funhouse, P!nk explains, “I look at life like a carnival. Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy. But, we go and we buy cotton candy and we force our laughter and we get on rides and we strap ourselves in and we do it. And that’s like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make you look so distorted that you don’t recognize yourself and you ask yourself, ‘How did I get here? How do I get out of here?’ But, you think that you want to do it again. That is the same as love and life. It’s a metaphor for being in love and for life.”\n\nThe title track itself is a funky rocker with the fists-in-the-air refrain of “This used to be our funhouse/But now it’s full of evil clowns/It’s time to start the countdown/I’m gonna burn it down.” “It’s about when the box you’re in doesn’t fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one,” says P!nk. “This was the first song I did with Tony Kanal of No Doubt and his writing partner Jimmy Harry. I fell in love with working with them. We wrote fun fucking songs together. We did ‘Funhouse’ and ‘Sober.’”\n\nP!nk stepped out of her comfort zone in the recording of Funhouse by working away from her usual stomping grounds of Los Angeles and New York for the first time. She recorded “One Foot Wrong,” a bluesy slow-cooked rocker showcasing the grittier side of the singer’s vocal talents, with British musician/writer/producer Eg White (Francis Anthony “Eg” White, who has worked on No. 1 albums by British singers Duffy and Adele) in his home studio in London. And, she headed to Stockholm, Sweden to work with Max Martin, who previously co-penned such hits as “Who Knew,” “U + Ur Hand,” and “Cuz I Can” from 2006’s I’m Not Dead.\n\n“It was really good to get out of my house and get away from my life. No distractions. No phones,” explains P!nk of her overseas sessions. “It was my first time working with Eg White and I just adore him. He’s eccentric and messy and fucking awesome. We worked in his basement while his wife would be cooking dinner upstairs with their three babies and I just loved it. It was really inspiring and a great change of pace – different people, different energy.”\n\nWith its mix of sad, thoughtful love songs and fun, upbeat, feisty rock anthems. P!nk achieved exactly what she wanted to on Funhouse. “It feels good to get people not just emoting and releasing all that energy, but getting angry and motivated too. It’s group therapy.”","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151031864361398","source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/557328_10151031864361398_1634765030_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Philadelphia, PA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":20736328,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pink","name":"P!nk","record_label":"LaFace/Jive","talking_about_count":392794,"username":"pink","website":"http://www.pinkspage.com/ http://www.myspace.com/pinkspage http://www.twitter.com/pink http://www.youtube.com/pinkVEVO http://www.youtube.com/pinkvideovaultSME http://www.youtube.com/pinkvideovault","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Daddy Yankee","id":"89833162489","info":{"id":"89833162489","about":"Official Fan Page// http://www.daddyyankee.com// Follow DY on twitter: @daddy_yankee // Follow DY on Instagram: @daddyyankee ","app_id":"0","bio":"El Artista Urbano De La Década \nCon más de ocho millones de discos vendidos, siete éxitos número 1 en la cartelera de radio Billboard, una película que resultó un éxito en la taquilla, y cuatro discos en el tope de las listas de venta, incluyendo el disco latino de más venta en la década, según la revista Billboard, Daddy Yankee es el Artista latino urbano más relevante en el mundo entero.\nGanador de múltiples premios Billboard y Grammy ha sido nombrado una de las personalidades más influyentes en el mundo por CNN y la revista Times, se le considera el artista que impulse la popularidad del género musical conocido como reggaetón alrededor del mundo. \nUn innovador constante, Yankee se ha desarrollado más allá de los confines de su género para convertirse en una figura principal de la música urbana. No solo popularizó un estilo musical que revoluciono el ambiente musical, también redefinió la visión del artista como el arquitecto de su propio destino y carrera.  \nComo fundador y CEO de su propia casa discográfica, El Cartel Records, Yankee impulsó el género de la música Latina Urbana del ámbito local al ámbito mundial, mucho antes que ninguna de las más importantes casas discográficas se tomaran el riesgo de promover un género cuya popularidad no había sido probada. El modelo de negocio que estableció Yankee para promover este género fue tan innovador que revolucionó la forma de mercadear, promover y distribuir la música latina. Este modelo le ha servido de estrategia a muchos talentos que actualmente han logrado desarrollarse y disfrutan de los frutos del mismo. \nSu más reciente incursión en el mundo de la actuación fue su participación en la serie dramática ganadora de un premio Emmy®, \"The Bold & The Beautiful\" (Belleza y Poder) y que transmite en más de 100 paises. En el 2008 Yankee protagonizó la película “Talento De Barrio” (ligeramente basada en su vida), la cual fue estrenada en los Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico y América Latina. La música de la película formó parte de un disco que ya ha vendido sobre 1 millón de copias alrededor del mundo, llegando a la posición número uno en las listas “Billboard’s Top Latin Album”  y el sencillo de “Pose” logró el primer lugar en la lista “Billboard’s Hot Latin Songs”. En el 2007 actuó en la serie \"Cane\" de CBS junto a Jimmy Smits.  En el presente, Yankee preside un imperio que incluye el Cartel Records, su casa de producción, su ya galardonada casa de publicación, la colonia DY para hombres, un programa de televisión con TV Azteca en México, múltiples iniciativas filantrópicas, y contratos de portavoz para diferentes marcas. Aparte de haber tenido su propia marca de zapatillas deportivas (a través de Reebok), protagonizar “Talento de Barrio” la película puertorriqueña que más taquillas ha vendido en la historia, Yankee ha tenido contratos internacionales con marcas tan importantes como Pepsi, Movistar (Chile), y Coors Light. El astro también lanzo DY, una fragancia para hombres en el 2008 y  más recientemente  en Agosto del 2010  se lanzo DYAmante, esta vez para las mujeres.  \n\nComprometido con la comunidad latina, Yankee creó su fundación “Corazón Guerrero”, la que trabaja activamente para transformar las vidas de miles de niños necesitados en su natal Puerto Rico, así como, en la Republica Dominicana y Colombia entre otros países, mejorando así su educación y estilo de vida. Los esfuerzos filantrópicos de Yankee lo convirtieron en el ganador del premio “Billboard’s Spirit of Hope Award”, que se otorga anualmente a un artista escogido por su compromiso a la ayuda humanitaria. \n Yankee regresó con su primera producción musical después de dos años de ausencia, titulado “Mundial”. Este álbum fue distribuido por Sony y representa la verdadera naturaleza de Daddy Yankee, 13 canciones (y tres 'bonus track' disponibles en iTunes).  El primer sencillo del álbum \"Descontrol\" ha alcanzado las primeras posiciones en los Billboard's Latin Rhythm charts.  A solo horas del lanzamiento de “Mundial”, el disco ha alcanzado el lugar número uno en iTunes Latino y Amazon.com. El disco incluye la canción \"Grito Mundial\" la cual fue seleccionada por ESPN Latino y Telefutura para musicalizar las campañas de la Copa Mundial FIFA 2010. \nTal vez mas dirigida a un público internacional que ninguno de sus discos anteriores,  “Mundial” llega después de un año donde Yankee se presentó en más de 50 escenarios totalmente vendidos alrededor del mundo, impulsando a la cadena CNN a nombrarlo “la figura del mundo artístico hispano más influyente en los Estados Unidos y Latino América”.   MÁS SOBRE DADDY YANKEE \n\n•\tDurante el 2009, Yankee fue el artista más buscado en Google en los países de Argentina y Chile, superado solamente por Michael Jackson. \n•\tEl atractivo del artista para dentro del mundo cibernético se hace evidente con el éxito de su página de internet HYPERLINK \"http://www.daddyyankee.com\"www.daddyyankee.com, una página innovadora e interactiva que presenta noticias de Yankee, actualizadas constantemente, además de ofrecer mercancía y material digital del artista.  \n•\t“Yankee en Puerto Rico es el termino popular para describir a alguien grande, fuerte e importante en lo que hace” dijo Yankee a la revista Billboard en el 2005. “Así que el nombre significa “Big Daddy””.  \n•\tDiez años después de sus primeros fogueos con DJ Playero, Yankee distribuyó su primer disco “El Cangri.com”, que a pesar de no tener distribución en Estados Unidos, pasó tres semanas en las listas de los “Billboard Top Latin Albums”. \n•\tLa carrera de Yankee continúo con el disco “Los Homeruns Vol. 1” que se distribuyó en el 2003 y durante 4 semanas, logró la posición número 8 en las listas Billboard.

Young Roger Barrett was actively encouraged in his music and art by his parents, and was successful at both while in school.\n\nHe knew Roger Waters from school and met David Gilmour as a teenager, so their friendships were established long before the formation of Pink Floyd. Roger Barrett acquired the nickname 'Syd' around the age of 14, in a reference to local drummer Sid Barrett, hence the ‘Syd’ spelling for differentiation.\n\nThe Barrett family home had hosted musical collaborations from 1962 onwards, the first fruits of which became Geoff Mott and the Mottoes, including Syd on rhythm guitar. In September 1962, Roger Waters left Cambridge for London to study architecture. Syd meanwhile had won a 2-year scholarship to Cambridge School of Art, where he re-established contact with David Gilmour, swapping guitar chords at lunchtime sessions.\n\nLondon’s Regent Street Polytechnic had by now welcomed not only Roger Waters but Richard Wright, a Londoner, and Nick Mason, who was born in Birmingham but relocated to Hampstead at age 2. Roger and Nick responded to a college advert recruiting band members, and duly formed Sigma 6, playing guitar and drums respectively. Richard Wright also joined, playing guitar, various brass instruments and keyboards, depending on whether a piano was available. \n\nAs well as Polytechnic studies, Richard was taking private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric Gilder School of Music, and in fact left architectural studies (and the band, now called The Abdabs) at the end of his first year, to go travelling.\n\nIn Autumn 1964 Syd Barrett moved to London to attend Camberwell Art College, hooking up with Roger Waters and the Abdabs. Two of the band had just left, which left space for two guitarists: Syd, and fellow Cambridge friend Rado (‘Bob’) Klose, Roger Waters having switched to bass guitar. Originally Leonard’s Lodgers, The Spectrum Five, and latterly The Tea Set, the band finally became Pink Floyd when Richard Wright rejoined, having returned to the UK to enroll in the Royal College of Music. The new name was suggested by Syd, and was derived from two US bluesmen: Pink (born Pinkney) Anderson and Floyd Council.\n\nThe 5-piece played intermittently in early 1965 as both The Tea Set and The Pink Floyd (or The Pink Floyd Sound), with the departure of Rado ‘Bob’ Klose creating the first 4-man (Barrett / Mason / Waters / Wright) lineup at live shows from May onwards (although the band continued to alternate the use of the Tea Set / Pink Floyd designation right up until March 1966).    \n\nThey were still a part-time band, allowing Syd to take off to France in August with David Gilmour, the pair being briefly detained by the St. Tropez police for busking.  \n  \nPink Floyd / Tea Set’s original style was based on American blues and r’n’b, but the birth of a UK psychedelic music scene allowed them to develop Syd’s performance-based ideas into something unique. Throughout 1966 they honed their live performance skills, often developing songs into long jamming sequences, and by the end of the year Pink Floyd had become the pre-eminent ‘underground’ band. They picked up management too, and their first recordings were songs by Syd, who had established himself as the band’s creative innovator.    \n\nPink Floyd signed to EMI Records in 1967, releasing the singles Arnold Layne and See Emily Play, both written by Syd, and the album The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, again mostly composed by Syd and considered to be one of the greatest British psychedelic albums.\n\nArnold Layne reached No. 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and See Emily Play reached No. 6, while The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn also entered the album charts at No. 6, the first of a long line of Pink Floyd album chart successes.\n\nHowever, as the band began to attract a large fanbase, it became clear that Syd's fluid approach to writing, performing and recording - spontaneous, one take only, nothing repeated -  was increasingly at odds with the expectations of a musical scene that was still very conservative, especially outside London.   \n\nPossibly exacerbated by Syd’s frequent experimentation with psychedelic drugs, his behaviour became more erratic, to the point that the band decided to add a second guitarist for live performances. They hoped to call on Syd’s compositional abilities for studio work, similar to Brian Wilson’s role in the Beach Boys, while David Gilmour would bolster the band in live shows.\n\nDavid Gilmour had gigged regularly around Cambridge with various outfits, including The Ramblers, Chris Ian & The Newcomers and Jokers Wild, his first professional outfit. David moved to London in Summer 1966, and the band, now a trio, played extensively around Europe. \nRenamed Bullitt, they then re-invented themselves as Flowers in 1967. Already known as the best guitarist on the Cambridge scene, David had been very impressed with seeing Jimi Hendrix in a small club, and had been inspired to work even harder on his technique.    \n\nThe new 5-man Floyd experiment didn’t really work, and In January 1968, after a handful of shows, the band elected not to pick Syd up on the way to a Southampton University gig.\n\nSyd and Floyd officially parted company in March 1968, with the band’s management Blackhill Enterprises deciding to stick with Syd as a solo artist. The band appointed Steve O'Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.\n\nWhilst Syd Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one composition by him, Jugband Blues, appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful Of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching Number 9 in the UK.\n\nPoint Me At The Sky, a Waters / Gilmour composition released in December 1968, was to be the band’s last single release until Money from The Dark Side Of The Moon.\n\nThe soundtrack to the film More, another UK Top 10 album in July 1969, was the band’s first collaboration with film director Barbet Schroeder.\n\nThe next record, the double album Ummagumma in November 1969, was a mix of live recordings and studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of a year, Syd Barrett had recorded The Madcap Laughs, released in January 1970, with some production help from David and Roger. \n\nAtom Heart Mother, in October 1970, was Pink Floyd's first recording with an orchestra, the title track suite taking up a full vinyl LP side. Their first UK No. 1 album, staying on the charts for 18 weeks, the title was taken from a London Evening Standard headline. \n\nRoger Waters’ first work outside the band appeared in November 1970. A collaboration with Ron Geesin, (with whom Floyd had worked on Atom Heart Mother), The Body formed the soundtrack to the film of the same name. Pink Floyd appear anonymously on the track Give Birth To A Smile.\n\n\nNovember 1970 also saw the release of Barrett, the second and last album of all-original Syd Barrett songs. It was produced by David Gilmour, and included Richard Wright on keyboards. \n\nBefore the next album of original material, a Pink Floyd compilation album, Relics, was released in May 1971, containing several early singles and B-sides, plus one previously unreleased song Biding My Time. The band also contributed three tracks to the soundtrack of Michelangelo Antonioni’s film, Zabriskie Point.\n\nIn October 1971 the band allowed director Adrian Maben to film them performing live in the amphitheatre at Pompeii. After more filming, including interviews and more performances in a Paris studio, the Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii film was finally premiered at the Edinburgh Festival in September 1972.\n\nMeddle was Pink Floyd’s longest UK chart performer to date, maintaining 82 weeks on the chart from its No. 3 debut in November 1971. It contained the LP side-long Echoes, to many the perfect encapsulation of all Floyd’s disparate elements. Nick Mason considered it \"the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to\".\n\nDeveloping the idea of thematic pieces, the band began to work on what would become The Dark Side of The Moon, presenting the songs from the album in concert throughout 1972. However, even though they were yet to enter the studio to record Dark Side as an album, the band took a detour to make another soundtrack album in just two weeks for Barbet Schroeder – Obscured By Clouds, to accompany the film La Vallee. \n\nThe release of Pink Floyd's massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side Of The Moon, was a watershed moment in the band's popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968's Point Me At The Sky and was never a hit-single-driven group, but Money was released \nas a single from The Dark Side Of The Moon, going Top 20 in the U.S. The album became the band's first No. 1 on the U.S. Charts and is one of the biggest-selling ever, worldwide.\n\nThe Piper At The Gates Of Dawn and A Saucerful Of Secrets were re-presented to the public in December 1973 as a 2 – LP set, A Nice Pair, repackaged in a gatefold sleeve. \n\n1975’s Wish You Were Here is well-known for its popular title track, but also the largely instrumental song suite Shine On You Crazy Diamond, an overt tribute to Syd Barrett. It bookends the album, the recording of which was made poignant for the band by Syd’s surprise appearance in the studio. He turned up unannounced at Abbey Road studios while the group were working on Shine On, leaving his former bandmates bemused.\nFor most of the band, it was their last meeting with Syd; Roger Waters subsequently viewed him in Harrods department store, but the two didn’t speak.\n\nThe years between 1976 and 1985 saw Roger Waters asserting more control over Pink Floyd's output, concentrating on thematic albums like Animals, released in January 1977. One of the many iconic Pink Floyd images is that of an inflatable pig flying over Battersea Power Station; the pig, 'Algie', escaped during the cover shoot, subsequently coming to earth in Kent.\n\nAs a side project, David released his first solo album, David Gilmour, in May 1978. Featuring Rick Wills on bass and Willie Wilson on drums and percussion, the album charted in the UK at No. 17 and the U.S. at No. 29.\n\nUsing material that was extraneous to the Animals album, Richard released his first solo project, Wet Dream, in September 1978.\n\nThe next Floyd release was the hugely successful The Wall. Preceded by the surprise UK & US No. 1 hit Another Brick In The Wall Part 2, the double album chronicling a rock star’s increasing alienation from the world of stardom was an instant hit.\n\nRoger Waters’ album concept extended to the stage presentation and the short run of live shows in the US and UK in 1980 (repeated in 1981 in the UK and Germany) remain in many peoples’ minds as the quintessential melding of music and theatrics in the rock idiom. \nRoger had written almost all of the songs, although one of them, destined to be a future Floyd classic, was a Waters / Gilmour collaboration: Comfortably Numb. The music was based on an outtake from David’s first solo album, which he tailored to fit Roger’s newly-coined lyrics.    \n\nRichard Wright’s relationship with Roger Waters had become increasingly rocky, and he left Pink Floyd during the Wall sessions. However, he was keen to complete the album’s live shows, so was retained as a salaried session musician during the subsequent live concerts in 1980 and 1981. \n\nThe Wall became a feature film, directed by Alan Parker and starring Bob Geldof. Some of the material was re-recorded or remixed, and the movie was premiered in May 1982 at Cannes, becoming a steady seller on VHS and subsequently DVD.  Pink Floyd The Wall won two BAFTA Awards in 1983 – Best Sound and Best Original Song (Another Brick In The Wall). \n\nNick Mason’s first album under his own name was Fictitious Sports, released in 1981. A mixture of jazz and rock, the compositions were by Carla Bley, who also played keyboards. Other contributors included Robert Wyatt, Mike Mantler and Chris Spedding.\n\nIn March 1983, Pink Floyd released the only album on which Richard does not appear - The Final Cut, once more a Roger Waters conceptual piece, and the band’s third UK No. 1.\n\nDavid's second solo album, About Face, was released in March 1984, hitting No. 21 in the UK and No. 32 in the US, going Gold.\n\nIn April 1984, Richard formed a new musical duo with Dave Harris (from the band Fashion) called Zee. They signed a record deal with Atlantic Records and released one album, Identity.\n\nRoger went on to work on a further concept album, this time as a solo artist: The Pros And Cons Of Hitch Hiking. Released in May 1984, the album was followed by a 9-date solo tour of the UK and Continental Europe. \n\nOne year after his bandmates' projects, Nick Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10CC.  David Gilmour contributes vocals to one track.\n\nIn December 1985 Roger Waters wrote to EMI and CBS (now Sony) Records, resigning from Pink Floyd. Nevertheless, when in 1986 David Gilmour and Nick Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album, a legal dispute ensued, eventually settled out of court.\n\nAfter considering and rejecting many other titles, the new Pink Floyd album was released as A Momentary Lapse Of Reason in September 1987. Richard Wright contributed to the album, rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.\n\nA year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound Of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film, La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring David and Nick as participating drivers. During the race, David and manager Steve O'Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. Steve suffered a broken leg; David walked away with a few bruises.\n\n1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9-disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful Of Secrets, Meddle, The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and A Momentary Lapse Of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Early Singles was also included. \n\nThe band's 1994 next album, The Division Bell, the title suggested by David's friend Douglas Adams, returned Pink Floyd to the No. 1 position in the UK & US, remaining on the charts in each country for 51 weeks. The album contained Marooned, composed by David and Richard, for which the band received their first and only Grammy Award in 1995 (Best Rock Instrumental Performance). \n\nThe lengthy Division Bell tour, playing to more than 5 million people, engendered the live album P*U*L*S*E in 1995, featuring songs from concerts in London, Rome, Hanover, and Modena.\n\nOn January 17, 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend.\n\nRichard Wright released his second solo album, Broken China, in September 1996. Richard sings throughout, with Momentary Lapse collaborator Anthony Moore providing some lyrics, and Sinead O’Connor guesting on vocals for two tracks.\n\nA live recording of The Wall appeared in 2000, compiled from the 1980-1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released.\n\nIn 2003, The Dark Side Of The Moon was issued as an SACD, featuring new cover artwork. The album was also re-released as a 180-gram, virgin vinyl pressing, including all the original album art from the original release of the album, plus a new poster.\n\nNick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History Of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Nick made public promotional appearances in a few European and American cities, giving interviews and meeting fans at book signings.\n\nLongtime Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on October 30, 2003. David, Nick, and Richard joined together at his funeral service in Chichester Cathedral to perform Fat Old Sun and The Great Gig In The Sky.\n\nTwo years later, on July 2, 2005, the Gilmour / Mason / Waters / Wright lineup took to the stage for the first time in 24 years in a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. Their four-song set included Breathe (plus reprise), Money, Wish You Were Here, and Comfortably Numb, with David and Roger sharing lead vocals. At the end of the band’s performance, their group hug became one of the most famous images of Live 8.\n\nSubsequent to the post- Live 8 sales boom for the participating artists, David Gilmour declared that he would donate his share of profits to charity, urging other artists and record companies to do the same. \n\nOn November 16, 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. David and Nick attended in person; Richard was in hospital following eye surgery; and Roger appeared on a video screen, from Rome.\n\n\n\nOn March 6, 2006,  David Gilmour released his third solo album, On An Island, which entered the charts at No. 1 in the UK and No. 6 in the US. A 3-month sold-out tour of concert venues in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. followed, performed with a band that included Richard Wright, plus Floyd regulars Dick Parry, Jon Carin, and Guy Pratt. Nick Mason joined the band for encores of Arnold Layne and Comfortably Numb at one of the Royal Albert Hall shows, which were filmed for the subsequent DVD / Blu-ray release Remember That Night.\n\nRoger ‘Syd’ Barrett died of pancreatic cancer on July 7, 2006 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, having suffered from diabetes for some time. His funeral was a private family affair, but his enduring influence was marked by the many heartfelt tributes recorded by fans and stars, touched by his idiosyncratic genius. \n\nOn July 10, 2006, the P*U*L*S*E DVD was released, launched with a media showing and Q&A session with David, Nick and Richard.  \n\nA tribute concert for Syd was held at the Barbican Centre in London on May 10, 2007. Madcap’s Last Laugh featured entertaining performances from Barrett fans such as Chrissie Hynde, Mike Heron and Nick Laird-Clowes, while an unbilled Roger Waters played an acoustic Flickering Flame. Roger had to leave before the end of the show, so was unavailable for a further surprise performance - David, Richard and Nick performing Arnold Layne to rapturous applause and a standing ovation.\n\nSeptember 2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI, marked by the release of a 2-CD set containing mono and stereo mixes of The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, and a 3-CD version including the related singles, B sides and other rare recordings.\n\nOn December 10 (UK) and 11 (U.S.), 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh By The Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Two albums (The Dark Side Of The Moon and A Momentary Lapse Of Reason) feature remastered versions.\n\nOn January 7 2010, Pink Floyd’s album artwork for The Division Bell, designed by Storm Thorgerson with sculptures by John Robertson, will be reproduced as a Royal Mail stamp. The series of ‘Classic Album Cover’ stamps features 10 iconic album sleeves, and sees The Division Bell rub shoulders with titles such as Let It Bleed by The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin IV by Led Zeppelin, and A Rush Of Blood To The Head by Coldplay.  \n\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150624394702308","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/431892_10150624394702308_1087772166_n.jpg","offset_y":35,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Cambridge, England","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":22587056,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pinkfloyd","name":"Pink Floyd","record_label":"This page is run and moderated by EMI.

I love the number 13. I was born in December on a Christmas tree farm. I like imagining what life was like hundreds of years ago. I have blurry eyesight. My favorite thing in life is writing about life, specifically the parts of life concerning love. Because, as far as I'm concerned, love is absolutely everything. \n\nI'm easily excited, thrilled, scared, and shocked. I'm 22 now, but I never stopped jumping up and down when something wonderful happens. My biggest fear is getting bad news. Or, letting someone down. I really love showing people what I meant when I wrote a song, so my shows are very theatrical. I knock on wood constantly. I have a cat named Meredith. She's named after my favorite character on Grey's Anatomy, and she's fantastic. I live in Nashville, a magical land where 99% of the people are friendly and courteous drivers who let you in and don't honk at you.\n\nI go into a trance when I'm in an antique store. I don't like it when something or someone turns out to be different than what you originally thought. Like when you're shopping and you find a really cute dress, only to realize it’s actually a strange jumpsuit situation. But I mostly don't like it when it happens with people. I love my friends and I'm always making new ones. I don't really think you can ever stop making new friends or learning about as many new things as possible. I also don't think you should ever take life so seriously that you forget to play. \n\nMusic has taken me all over the world, but the fans are the reason it's been so magical. I'm so blown away by how nice they are to me. It's strange to feel so understood by such a large group of people, but I love it. For the last two years, I've been working on an album called Red. I called it that because of the tumultuous, crazy adventures in love and loss that it chronicles. In my mind, when you experience love that's fast paced and out of control and mixes infatuation, jealousy, frustration, miscommunication, and all of those lovely emotions… In retrospect, it all looks red. \n\nI can't wait for so many things. But mostly I can't wait to see you, whether it's in a crowd or a coffee shop. Thank you for listening, showing up, reading, and taking such good care of me.\n\n--Taylor","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151381604985369","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/s720x720/576836_10151381604985369_269105593_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Country","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":43016329,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/TaylorSwift","name":"Taylor Swift","record_label":"Big Machine Records","talking_about_count":332837,"username":"TaylorSwift","website":"http://www.taylorswift.com http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Bruno Mars","id":"242567287243","info":{"id":"242567287243","about":"#MySecondAlbumIsOutSon #Unorthodox Jukebox http://smarturl.it/unorthodoxjukebox","app_id":"0","booking_agent":"John Marx - JPMassts@wmeentertainment.com          Mark Ngui  MNgui@caa.com  Tel + 44 20.8846.3000  for booking in UK, Europe and South America ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151521899367244","source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/601989_10151521899367244_1022366715_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","general_manager":"info@thecreedco.com","genre":"Rock / Soul / Experimental","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":34920283,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/thatbrunomars","name":"Bruno Mars","record_label":"Atlantic Records","talking_about_count":316597,"username":"thatbrunomars","website":"http://www.brunomars.com http://twitter.com/brunomars","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Lady Gaga","id":"10376464573","info":{"id":"10376464573","about":"BORN THIS WAY THE ALBUM AVAILABLE NOW! http://bit.ly/mFqY5L","app_id":"0","bio":"Lady Gaga came to prominence following the release of her debut studio album The Fame (2008), which included the hits \"Just Dance,\" \"Poker Face,\" and \"Bad Romance\" and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.

Better known as Wiz Khalifa, the son of two military parents has always had his eye on being a new standard by which cool is measured. Rapping since the third grade and starting to record music at 14 was probably a step in the right direction. The next best move? Inking a deal to Rostrum Records after a meeting with Benjy Grinberg.\n\nFresh out of high school, it was time to either sink or swim. In 2005 Wiz released his first mixtape, “Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania.” The mixtape was quickly accepted by the local scene and began to gain buzz outside of Pittsburgh. With that excitement growing by the day, it was the perfect time for a proper commercial album. Wiz soon dropped “Show and Prove,” which Okayplayer.com claimed was “arguably the best album of the year.” The accolades began piling up and Khalifa was receiving significant co-signs from XXL, Rolling Stone, and VIBE, alike. A deal with Warner Bros. Records soon followed.\n\nAny other 20-year-old probably would’ve let all this hype go to their heads, but not Wiz. As focused as ever, Wiz only saw this praise as an opportunity to work harder. In 2007, with the help of famed mixtape DJ, Green Lantern, Wiz released “Grow Season,” which was soon followed by “Prince of The City 2.” The sequel to “Prince of The City” would soon out grow its predecessor so much so that the demand for Khalifa’s music was greater than ever.\n\nUnfortunately, the relationship between Khalifa and Warner Bros. dissolved, and once again, Wiz found himself as an independent artist. Typically a huge roadblock for any artist, Wiz refused to allow the lack of a major label deal to slow down his momentum. He and his Rostrum team hit the ground running in 2009 and released three highly acclaimed mixtapes: “Flight School,” “How Fly,” a collaborative mixtape with New Orleans rapper Curren$y, and “Burn After Rolling.” The album “Deal Or No Deal” followed in the Fall and debuted at the top of the iTunes “Hip-Hop” chart, and has remained in the top 50 to date.\n\nIn the months following, both his fanbase (known as the “Taylor Gang”) and the anticipation for his new mixtape grew daily. Once Wiz dropped “Kush & Orange Juice” in early 2010, it was clear that he had established himself as one of the rap-game’s brightest young stars to watch. With an unprecedented amount of downloads, not to mention both the top search on Google as well as the number one trending topic on Twitter, it seemed as if the entire nation was on board with the “Taylor Gang” movement. Many said that the release of “Kush & Orange Juice” placed Wiz as the valedictorian of his “XXL Freshmen 10” class and kicked open the doors he and his team were looking to walk through.\n\nFast forward a few months, and together Wiz and Rostrum Records proudly announced that these doors were those of Atlantic Records, the new home to Wiz Khalifa. Following this huge milestone in his career, Wiz soon embarked on a stint on the famed “Rock The Bells” tour alongside such legends as Lauryn Hill and Snoop Dogg, immediately followed by his nation-wide headlining tour, appropriately dubbed the “Waken Baken Tour.” After receiving co-signs from a multitude of rap veterans, including Rick Ross and Diddy, and humbly rejecting Drake’s offer to join his recent tour, it became evident that Wiz also established himself as a prominent staple online with over 3,000,000 friends on Facebook, and over 1,000,000 fans following him on Twitter. With the video for his first Atlantic Records release, “Black & Yellow,” getting an astonishing 30 million views on YouTube, there is no question about it: Wiz Khalifa’s debut album is bound to be something great.","booking_agent":"peter@theagencygroup.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151584739561142","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/317321_10151584739561142_1594398481_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Pittsburgh, PA","general_manager":"booking@rostrumrecords.com","genre":"Hip Hop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Pittsburgh, PA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":21223446,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/wizkhalifa","name":"Wiz Khalifa","press_contact":"artie@rostrumrecords.com","record_label":"Rostrum Records","talking_about_count":299218,"username":"wizkhalifa","website":"www.wizkhalifa.com www.RostrumRecords.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Daft Punk","id":"22476490672","info":{"id":"22476490672","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"Sebastien Tellier, SebastiAn, Kavinsky, Ratatat, Phoenix, Alan Braxe, DJ Falcon","band_members":"Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo\nThomas Bangalter\n","bio":"Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met on the grounds of their lycée in Paris in 1987. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The indie rock trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom.[8] Bangalter felt that \"The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it.\" A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music \"a bunch of daft punk.\" Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing.[4] As the latter stated, \"We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly.\" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix.[5] Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.\nIn 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, \"The New Wave\", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of \"The New Wave\" called \"Alive\".\nDaft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record \"Da Funk\". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of \"Da Funk\", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax. \"Da Funk\" and \"Alive\" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. The most successful single from Homework was \"Around the World\", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title. Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.\nBy 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood.[8] This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. It reached #2 in the UK, and its single \"One More Time\" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" were also very successful in the UK and on the U.S. dance chart, and \"Face to Face\" hit #1 on the U.S. club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.\n2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.\nStarting on September 13, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were \"Robot Rock\", \"Technologic\", \"Human After All\" and \"The Prime Time of Your Life\". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was \"we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.\"\nA Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on April 4, 2006. It contains new music videos for \"The Prime Time of Your Life\" and \"Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)\". Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.\nOn May 21, 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007. Initial public comments have since been positive.\nDaft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on November 19, 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Oliver Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island.\nThe highly anticipated original motion picture score for TRON: Legacy, composed and produced by Daft Punk, will be released by Walt Disney Records / EMI Music on Monday, December 6 2010.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151561855400673","source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/644620_10151561855400673_2067644029_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":120},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Paris, France","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8184550,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/daftpunk","name":"Daft Punk","press_contact":"Kathryn Frazier @ Biz 3","talking_about_count":297177,"username":"daftpunk","website":"http://www.daftpunk.com/ http://www.daft-musique.com/ http://www.myspace.com/daftpunk http://www.youtube.com/daftpunkalive ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Justin Bieber","id":"67253243887","info":{"id":"67253243887","about":"http://smarturl.it/jbmktg  www.BIEBERFEVER.com www.justinbiebermusic.com www.justinbieberneversaynever.com **************************** Twitter @JustinBieber","app_id":"0","bio":"An old soul is the last thing you would expect to find inside Justin Bieber.  But all it takes is one listen to the 15 year-old soul-singing phenomenon to realize that he is light years ahead of his manufactured pop peers. \n\nAfter posting dozens of homemade videos on YouTube in 2007, where the multi-talented Bieber put his impeccable spin on songs from artists like Usher, Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder, Justin racked up over 10,000,000 views purely from word of mouth. \n\n“I started singing about three years ago,” says the Canadian native who grew up an only child in Stratford, Ontario. “I entered a local singing competition called Stratford Idol. The other people in the competition had been taking singing lessons and had vocal coaches. I wasn’t taking it too seriously at the time, I would just sing around the house. I was only 12 and I got second place.”\n\nIn an effort to share his victory with his loved ones, Justin began posting his performance footage online. “I put my singing videos from the competition on YouTube so that my friends and family could watch them,” he says. “But it turned out that other people liked them and they started subscribing to them. That’s how my manager found me. He saw me on YouTube and contacted my family and now I’m signed!”\n\nSeven months after Justin started posting his videos online, former So So Def marketing executive Scooter Braun flew the then 13-year old singer to Atlanta, GA to meet with his elite colleagues. As if Justin’s natural singing talent wasn’t enough to impress Scooter’s inner circle, Braun knew Bieber was also a self-taught musician who plays the drums, guitar, piano and trumpet.\n\n“Right when we flew into Atlanta, Scooter drove us to the studio and Usher was there in the parking lot,” remembers Bieber. “That was my first time ever being out of Canada so I went up to him and was like, ‘Hey Usher, I love your songs, do you want me to sing you one?’ He was like, ‘No little buddy, just come inside, it’s cold out.’” \n\nAll it took was a short time online for Usher to realize he was in the company of a future superstar. “A week later Usher flew me back to Atlanta,” says Bieber. “I sang for him and his people and he really wanted to sign me then and there but I still had a meeting with Justin Timberlake who also wanted to sign me.  It turned out Usher’s deal was way better. He had L.A. Reid backing him up and Scooter has alot of connections and is really smart.  I always tease Usher now and remind him he how he blew me off the first time we met.”\n\nIn October of 2008, Justin Bieber officially signed to a joint venture between Usher and Scooter Braun's new label RBMG and Island Records.  His debut album, My World is an intimate look into the mind of a budding young renaissance man. With production from star hit men like The Dream and Tricky Stewart who produced “Umbrella” for Rihanna and Beyonce’s latest smash, “Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It),” Justin has everything he needs to achieve pop supremacy. \n\nHis first single, “One Time” produced by Tricky, is about one of Justin’s favorite topics, puppy love.  Usher joins Justin on “First Dance” where the two share verses on a song that Bieber describes as, “A slow groovy song that people can dance to.” On the Midi-Mafia produced “Down to Earth” Justin digs deep to talk about growing up.  “Bigger” finds the teenaged singer maturing at a steady rate, while motivating his listeners to strive for their goals.\n\n“I’m looking forward to influencing others in a positive way,” says Justin. “My message is you can do anything if you just put your mind to it. I grew up below the poverty line; I didn’t have as much as other people did.  I think it made me stronger as a person it built my character.  Now I have a 4.0 grade point average and I want to go to college and just become a better person.” \n\nA virtually untapped well of natural artistic talent, Justin Bieber is primed to be a solid force in music for many years to come. “I think older people can appreciate my music because I really show my heart when I sing, and it’s not corny,” he says. “I think I can grow as an artist and my fans will grow with me.” And just think, he’s just getting started.\n\n\n","booking_agent":"Creative Arts Agency mcoffice@caa.com ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":105,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151062047613888","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/389573_10151062047613888_1122348305_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"general_manager":"Scooter Braun","genre":"Pop R&B","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Stratford, ON","influences":"Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Usher","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":53409370,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/JustinBieber","location":{"street":"","city":"Stratford","state":"ON","country":"Canada","zip":"","latitude":40.763468102655,"longitude":-73.986905124879},"name":"Justin Bieber","record_label":"Island DefJam/ RBMG/ SchoolBoy","talking_about_count":296537,"username":"JustinBieber","website":"http://smarturl.it/jbmktg www.BIEBERFEVER.com www.JUSTINBIEBERMUSIC.com www.twitter.com/justinbieber www.youtube.com/justinbieber www.youtube.com/kidrauhl www.facebook.com/justinbieber www.myspace.com/justinbieber http://ilike.com/artist/Justin+Bieber ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Adele","id":"9770929278","info":{"id":"9770929278","about":"Adele 21\nOrder Now\nhttp://www.adele.tv/21\n\nAdele 19\nOUT NOW\nhttp://bit.ly/66Nk5d\n\nSign up for my email list\nhttp://bit.ly/cK497P","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150688480514279","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/541465_10150688480514279_329632584_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop, Soul","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"London","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":42593316,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/adele","name":"Adele","record_label":"XL Recordings/Columbia (US)","talking_about_count":291850,"username":"adele","website":"www.adele.tv\nwww.myspace.com/adelelondon\nwww.xlrecordings.com\nwww.youtube.com/adelelondon\nwww.twitter.com/officialadele\nPing: http://c.itunes.apple.com/us/profile/id-10213","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda, Corridos, Armas, Cuacos & Tequila = Perfección","id":"437529732982322","info":{"id":"437529732982322","about":"Si Te Gusta La Banda, Corridos  & Cuacos..Puchale Al ME GUSTA\n@[437529732982322:] pega eso en tu muro & ve lo que pasa :3 <3\nwww.facebook.com/BrandomTwiins\n","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":491437497591545,"source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/s720x720/600953_491437497591545_1596319059_n.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0},"description":"░░█░█░█░░█░█▀▀░▀█▀░█▀▀░░░ ░░█░█░██░█░█▀░░░█░░█▀░░░░ ░░▀▄▀░█░▀█░█▄▄░░█░░█▄▄░░░ ───────────────────────── ────────▄▀▀▄───────────── ────────█──█───────────── ────────█──█▄▄─────────── ────────█──█──█▀▀▄▄────── ────▄▄▄─█──█──█──█─▀▄──── ────█──▀█────────▀──█──── ─────▀▄─█───────────█──── ──────▀▄───────────█───── ───────▀▄──────────█───── ─────────█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄█──────","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":141935,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/BandaCorridosArmasCuacosYTequilaPERFECCION","name":"Banda, Corridos, Armas, Cuacos & Tequila = Perfección","talking_about_count":288094,"username":"BandaCorridosArmasCuacosYTequilaPERFECCION","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Metallica","id":"10212595263","info":{"id":"10212595263","about":"Quebec Magnetic - DVD/Blu-Ray In Stores Now www.metallica.com - www.livemetallica.com - www.twitter.com/metallica","app_id":"0","band_members":"James Hetfield\nLars Ulrich\nKirk Hammett\nRobert Trujillo","bio":"Formed in 1981 by drummer Lars Ulrich and guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield, Metallica have become one of the most influential and commercially successful rock bands in history, having sold 100 million albums worldwide and playing to millions of fans the world over.

The band has sold in excess of 11 million records worldwide and had eight No.1 singles at Active Rock Radio. Smash hit \"Inside the Fire\" garnered the band their first Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance in 2009. All of these accomplishments have set the stage for Disturbed to open their Asylum.\n\nDisturbed began building Asylum as soon as they got off the road in the summer of 2009. Officially entering Groovemaster Studios in February 2010, the band set about self-producing the album, as they did with Indestructible. Draiman declares, \"This record shows a certain degree of maturation and enhanced complexity. Asylum is still identifiably Disturbed, but the evolution is clear. It preserves the elements of what we do but at a more advanced level.\"\n\n\"We took our signature foundation, and we tried to build on that,\" adds Donegan. \"For every album, we've pushed ourselves even more than in the past. Asylum is no exception.\"\n\nThere's a duality to the title that encapsulates a thematic thread for Draiman. \"The immediate connotation of the word Asylum is the image of a mental hospital or sanitarium, but it's also meant to be a haven or a safe place,\" says the singer. \"The dual meaning of the word pushed things over the edge for me. The title track itself deals with the memory of a lost love driving you. You're not able to let go of that memory and it brings you to the point of insanity. At the same time, that memory is a safe place for you; it's a haven you go to when times are tough. Overall, this record is a reflection of that.\"\n\nFirst single \"Another Way to Die\" is classic Disturbed, blending a syncopated riff with a hypnotic hook. Donegan reveals, \"Thematically, the song's about global warming and how the choices we make affect the planet. It's a new topic for us, and it'll hopefully raise a little awareness.\"\n\nStorytelling remains a central component of Asylum. About \"Animal\" Draiman states, \"That song is huge. It's written about someone who is an actual werewolf, and it's inspired by films like Underworld and Wolfman. It's about someone who enjoys the power and lives for the transformation.”At points, the lyrics become nearly cinematic in scope. Draiman goes on, \"All of the songs deal with dramatic elements such as pain, loss, suffering and remorse. There are no flowery subjects here. The lyrics on this record are a lot less cryptic than they've been in the past. They're far more direct. I felt it was time for me to write like that. Some of these subjects required that approach, and these songs tell stories.\"\n\nNot only did the band tread new territory lyrically on Asylum but also musically. Their first instrumental track \"Remnants\" ignites the album intensely. Donegan divulges, \"We've never done a pure instrumental piece before. Our plan was to start the album that way and build anticipation with something fresh. The vibe sets everything up perfectly.\"\n\nThen there's \"The Infection,\" which will no doubt be a crowd favorite. From its percussive stomp to the wah-pedal solo, the song feels like it could derail, but it's forged together by Disturbed's focused fire. \"It's one of those tracks that makes you feel like getting in the car and going over 100 mph,\" laughs Donegan. \"It's got a cool driving groove and an extended lead.\"\n\n\"This is a statement for us,” says Draiman. “We've never strayed from our identity. Disturbed records are always going to be rhythmic and powerful. They're always going to deal with the darker side of things. They're always going to be records you can take with you for a little bit of inspiration.

In early March 2010, Maher's debut album “Thank You Allah” (released by Awakening Records) was the No.1 highest selling album on Amazon in the world music section and Number 8 in the R&B section. With the release his second album “Forgive Me” Maher continues to inspire the world through his music. Maher has already had concerts in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Sweden, France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Bosnia, UAE, Egypt, Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore & Thailand to mention just a few. With his passion, incredible talent and unique style, the sky is the limit for Maher. \n\nMaher Zain’s first musical inspiration came from his father, who was a singer himself, performing locally in the beautiful Mediterranean city of Tripoli - Lebanon. Fascinated by the music and instruments, Maher got his first keyboard when he was only ten and ever since music officially became part of Maher’s world. \nThe family moved to Sweden when Maher was only 8, where he continued his schooling, and later entered university and got a Bachelors degree in Aeronautical Engineering. With things changing around him, one thing remained the same - his passion for music. He would spend late nights at school with his friends where they would sing, rap, compose and experiment with music in every way. It didn’t take him long to realize that music became an integral part of who he is. \n\nAfter being involved for a while in the music scene in Sweden as a music producer, Maher was introduced to RedOne, a gifted music producer who was fast rising in the music scene in Sweden. Maher started working with RedOne with Swedish artists, and later moved with him to New York. For a few years he was in the middle of the hot rush of the NY music industry, working with chart topping artists such as Kat Deluna on her debut album that included smash hits ‘Whine up’ and ‘Run the Show’. Maher had what many would describe as a dream job for someone so young in such a glamorous business, but Maher still felt like something is missing. “I loved the music but I hated everything that surrounded it, it always felt like something wasn’t right.” RedOne was on the verge of breaking into the big time, going on to work with artists like Akon, Lady Gaga, Enrique Iglesias, Brandy, New Kids on the Block, and Michael Jackson to mention just a few, and becoming one of the most sought-after music producers in the world. Maher however was restless and eventually decided that the music industry and all that surrounded wasn’t the right place for him and he returned to Sweden.\n  \nIn early 2009, Maher Zain re-entered the music industry albeit with a different kind of music and decided to work with Awakening Records (UK) on an album that reflects his identity – Arab, Muslim and Swedish. His debut album ‘Thank You Allah’ was released by Awakening Records in October 2009 to international acclaim. The album went on to become a multi-platinum success, reaching the number 1 spot on Amazon’s World Music charts and number 9 on the R&B charts, and picking up 10 platinum awards in Malaysia alone - making it officially the best selling music album in Malaysia in 2010 and indeed in the last decade. Maher has already performed in sold-out concerts in Sweden, Canada, Australia, US, France, UK, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria, Malaysia, Bahrain, Algeria, and Egypt to name just a few.\n\nIn April 2012, Maher Zain’s second album “Forgive Me” was released. The album is a dynamic and modern mix of East & West and is expected to surpass the success of the debut album and captivate the senses of the audiences worldwide.\n\nMaher Zain’s music mixes the sounds of R&B with traditional spiritual, soul and contemporary pop music, not just updating spiritual music and inshad but fearlessly reviving it with contemporary flair. Maher’s songs are instant classics of great power and timeless, unassailably intense spirituality.\n","booking_agent":"contact@awakening.org","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151610268232970","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/21191_10151610268232970_698245654_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"general_manager":"AE2 (Awakening Entertainment)","genre":"RnB | Soul | Islamic Music","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Stockholm,  Sweden","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":7033771,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/MaherZain","name":"Maher Zain","press_contact":"contact@awakening.org","record_label":"Awakening Records","release_date":"\"Forgive Me\" the new album is out now in shops http://bit.ly/WTAnO1 & on iTuneshttp://bit.ly/HK0VgI","talking_about_count":254134,"username":"MaherZain","website":"www.awakening.org","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Gustavo Lima Oficial","id":"395683590463854","info":{"id":"395683590463854","about":"você é Fã também, junte-se a nos.

We figured we’d get there first.”\n\nCheck this out, though: If Overexposed gets at the truth of Maroon 5’s sky-high visibility—perhaps you’re reading these words in preparation for spreading the word a little further yourself—the title carries another meaning, as well, one that runs a few inches below the surface of things. After a decade of activity in which the 3 time Grammy-winning quintet has gone from playing tiny L.A. clubs to becoming one of the biggest bands in the world, this album captures Maroon 5’s decision to open itself up to risk.\n\n“I feel like we’ve been standing on the edge of a cliff for a long time,” Levine says. “We’re a band that’s always been close to being full-on pop, but that’s rooted in a lot of other things: rock, soul, funk, the list goes on. Overexposed is the first time we’ve ever completely embraced the idea of making pop music—of making songs for the radio. We just said, ‘Let’s not be afraid to do what we basically are.’”\n\nThe decision was more than a matter of mindset. “Moves Like Jagger” marked the band’s entrance into the waters of co-writing; until then Levine and his bandmates—guitarist James Valentine, bassist Mickey Madden, drummer Matt Flynn and keyboardist PJ Morton (currently filling in for Jesse Carmichael, who’s on hiatus)—had prided themselves on the fact that they handled all of the oufit’s music in-house. “But ‘Jagger’ was an amazing experience,” says Valentine, “so we figured we’d try it again.”\n\nThe result, Maroon 5’s fourth studio set, contains collaborations with longtime hitmaker Max Martin served as the album’s executive producer, with additional tracks produced by Benny Blanco (Katy Perry, Gym Class Heroes) and Ryan Tedder (Beyoncé, OneRepublic).\n\n“We gravitated toward certain people for various reasons,” Levine says, pointing to Maroon 5’s 2010 tour with OneRepublic as an example. “But when you get down to it, there’s a reason that the best writers in the world are as successful as they are. And there’s a lot of people on this record who had never been in a room together until we put them there. We were into making these strange concoctions that don’t exist in the rules.”\n\nIndeed, cuts like the electro-reggae “One More Night” and lead single “Payphone,” with a guest verse by rapper Wiz Khalifa, demonstrate how difficult it is to categorize Maroon 5’s; the same goes for the funked-up ballad “Beautiful Goodbye” and “Doin’ Dirt,” a propulsive disco-rock jam with harmonies that Valentine says reveal the influence of Hall & Oates.\n\n “I love how ‘Payphone’ seems like a such sweet song until the chorus comes in,” Levine says, referring to the part of that tune where he declares, “All those fairy tales are full of shit / One more fucking love song, I’ll be sick.” “It’s totally subverting the song in this way that makes you lean in and listen,” he adds.\n\n“I think I might be most stoked on ‘Fortune Teller,’ which started on my laptop while we were in the lounge at Conway Studios in L.A.,” says Valentine. “We’re literally feet away from millions of dollars of the world’s finest recording equipment, and I’m in there working on this 10-dollar Korg mini-keyboard.” He laughs. “And yet we came up with this track that we just loved.”\n\nAs Valentine’s comment suggests, Maroon 5 worked surprisingly quickly on Overexposed, which despite the A-list hook-ups arrives just 21 months after Hands All Over, the band’s 2010 collaboration with producer Robert John “Mutt” Lange. “We’ve taken a really long time to make our albums in the past,” Levine admits. “But I’m done overanalyzing and making things more complicated than they need to be. If a song is great, it’s great. Be done with it.”\n\n“There’s a new focus that’s set into us both personally and as a band,” Valentine adds. “We had such amazing experiences the first 10 years of this group, and I think we spent a lot of time enjoying it, which was great. But now it’s like, ‘Well, what do we do? We make records.’” The guitarist laughs. “Put it this way: In 2007 after the show we were definitely finding out where the party was. Now it’s more like, ‘Hey, let’s go finish that song.’ That’s what’s more exciting to us.”\n\nLevine says that of all the band’s albums, Overexposed feels “both most and least like Maroon 5. There’s lots of traces of the past, but it also hints at a new idea,” the singer explains. “More than anything I think this record says that it’s always cool to try—that you should always be willing to take a step beyond whatever feels comfortable.”\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151616161858482","source":"http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/s720x720/969356_10151616161858482_1199001549_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":20877266,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/maroon5","name":"Maroon 5","record_label":"A&M / Octone Records","talking_about_count":245451,"username":"maroon5","website":"http://www.maroon5.com http://twitter.com/maroon5 http://t.sina.com.cn/1973446175/profile (Weibo) www.myspace.com/maroon5 http://www.bobcarmichael.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Katy Perry","id":"7126051465","info":{"id":"7126051465","about":"Download 'Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection' on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/KatyPerry","app_id":"0","band_members":"Katy Perry","bio":"When Katy Perry was a fourth grader, her teacher asked the class to make a “vision board” — a collage of images cut out from magazines that represents the dreams and aspirations you hope to manifest in life. The year was 1993 and Selena had just won a Grammy Award, so nine-year-old Katy chose a photo of the young Latin pop singer holding her golden statuette. Fifteen years later, Perry has been nominated for her first Grammy Award in the “Best Female Pop Vocal Performance” category for her ubiquitous No. 1 single, \"I Kissed a Girl,\" from her platinum Top 10 album One of the Boys, and has been chosen as this year’s My GRAMMY® Moment artist.  Current sales check in at over 2 million albums and more than 13 million tracks, singles and mobile product globally.\n\n“I found my vision board when I moved apartments recently,” says Perry, now 24. “I knew where I wanted to be even as a young kid. I just didn’t know that if I put one foot in front of the other, I would actually get there someday.” \n\nPerry’s willful determination, not to mention her songwriting and vocal talent and larger-than-life charisma, have led to an astonishing year for the saucer-eyed, raven-haired pop starlet, who, with her cheeky sense of humor and sexy pin-up girl style, was “the breakthrough star of 2008” as Blender magazine put it in the issue that featured Perry on the cover. \n\nYou could say it all started in April 2008 when Madonna told Ryan Seacrest that Perry’s “Ur So Gay” (off her November 2007 EP of the same name) — a withering kiss-off to a metrosexual ex — was her favorite song. “It may have been a small comment on her behalf, but it was a large comment in my world,” Perry recalls. “It was like a big boat leaving the dock and getting a champagne send-off.” Shortly after being anointed by the Queen of Pop, Perry released her debut single “I Kissed A Girl” — a provocative ode to the beauty of women that ruled radio over the summer of 2008, becoming an all-format hit and shooting to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 where it stayed put for seven straight weeks and tied The Beatles’ Capitol Records record for weeks at No. 1. The video was nominated for five MTV Video Music Awards, including a nod for Perry for “Best New Artist” and became the No. 1 most viewed music video of 2008 on MySpace. A No. 1 airplay smash in 22 countries and the 2009 People’s Choice award winner for “Favorite Pop Song,” “I Kissed A Girl” has sold more than six million tracks worldwide. Its popularity also made Perry a ripe target for Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, who convened a panel of hand-wringing analysts to discuss the effect of the song on America’s impressionable youth. Perry was also voted “Best New Artist” by readers of Rolling Stone and PerezHilton.com\n\nOn June 17, 2008, EMI Music released One of the Boys, a witty romp through Perry’s brightly colored world that showcases her sharp, candid lyrics, big voice, and feisty, girl-power swagger, as well as her appealing vulnerability on songs like her latest single, “Thinking Of You.” “I think people can appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides,” she says. “The whole angst thing is cool, but if that’s all you’ve got, it's just boring. Everything I write, whether it’s happy or sad, has a sense of humor to it.” Case in point: the album’s spunky, high-voltage second single “Hot N Cold,” which became Perry’s second No. 1 single and international hit, selling nearly three million digital tracks since its release. The eye-popping video, with its hilarious wedding theme, became the No. 2 most-viewed premiere of all time on MySpace, proving to armchair critics and naysayers that the success of this irrepressible young woman in the satin onesie and fishnets was no fluke. When Saturday Night Live spoofed her, it was official: Katy Perry was a bonafide cultural phenomenon. \n\nSo why does Perry think that she’s connected with a mass audience when the road to stardom is littered with the failed dreams of aspiring wannabes? “Because I’m just myself,” she says, “and that’s all people want. People want to hear artists who are themselves, but who do interesting things and sing about them in an interesting way that maybe they have tried to conceive but couldn’t. I get a lot of girls who come up to me and say, ‘When I heard ‘Thinking of You,’ I felt that way to a T, but I never knew anyone who could put my feelings into words.’ I think that’s why people find me relatable. Plus, anybody can meet me. I’m not distant. I’m very much the same person I was before the hit singles. I just have a schedule for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.”\n\nFans do seem to respond to Perry’s approachable girl-next-door quality (if the girl next door were a self-described “glamour ninja”), perhaps because it’s not an act. The middle child of two pastors, Perry grew up singing in church. “My dad would give me ten dollars, which is a lot of money when you’re nine, to sing at church, on tables at restaurants, at family functions, just about anywhere,” she says. Perry was raised on a strict diet of church music; “secular music,” as her mother called it, was “not allowed.” But one night during a slumber party, Perry happened upon a Queen record “and the heavens opened and saved me,” she says. “From then on, they have been my biggest influence. Their musicality and lyrics were so flamboyant and real. I’d never heard anything like it.”\n\nBy the time she was 15, Perry was determined to pursue a path in music. She spent some time in Nashville working with professional songwriters — “these seasoned country music vets who had been writing songs for forever” — and honing her own songwriting skills. “Every single one of my songs is drawn 100 percent directly from my life.” At 17, Perry met legendary producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, who spent years guiding and developing her talent and songwriting. The strength of the songs and Perry’s full-throated voice captured the attention of Capitol Music Group, which signed her in Spring 2007. “I’ve been through a lot of highs and a lot of lows in this business,” Perry says. “Before I got signed, it was tough. I’d write a check for my rent and next to it, I’d write, ‘Please, God, please.’ But I didn’t jump off the Hollywood sign. Everything always works out for the best.”\n\nIt’s a long way from being broke to stealing the show at the MTV Latin America “Los Premios Awards” (where Perry face-planted into a large pink cake) and hosting and performing at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Liverpool, England, which she did in November 2008, picking up the award for “Best New Act” in the process. Now Perry is gearing up for her first-ever international headlining tour, something she’s ready to tackle after spending a grueling summer on the Vans Warped Tour — a multi-band circus that one critic likened “the running of the bulls in Pamplona...minus the bulls, or the quaint Basque scenery.” “Warped was the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” Perry admits. “It was like being in the army, like GI Jane getting my ass kicked every single day, but now I know how to deal with any situation.”\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151281552296466","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/s720x720/419362_10151281552296466_1286816638_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop-Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":53603971,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/katyperry","name":"Katy Perry","record_label":"Capitol Records","talking_about_count":242243,"username":"katyperry","website":"http://www.katyperry.com http://www.myspace.com/katyperry http://www.twitter.com/katyperry","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"The Beatles","id":"69116329538","info":{"id":"69116329538","about":"The Beatles on iTunes: http://bit.ly/aXzDm8  For the latest news register for our newsletter at http://www.thebeatles.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"John Lennon\nPaul McCartney\nGeorge Harrison\nRingo Starr","bio":"\"The story began in Harold Macmillan’s “never had it so good” ’50s Britain.

The narrative that began where Paul met John and clicked at a garden fete in leafy Liverpool, and ended in high dudgeon in high-end London, is so far fetched that it needs the power of a song punctuating every page to remind you with a joyous jolt that it was all true.\n\nWe didn’t dream it... though it came out of John’s dream of the “man on a flaming pie” who said “You are Beatles with an ‘A’”. It did all happen. The whole wonderful thing did happen, a long time ago, on the Mersey, on the Elbe, by the Thames and the Hudson River.\n\nAmazing and marvellous and, nearly [fifty] years on, forever young.\" \nDerek Taylor\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151601567999539","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/601771_10151601567999539_1262474389_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":84},"current_location":"London","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Liverpool","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":33735500,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/thebeatles","name":"The Beatles","record_label":"This page is run and moderated by EMI & Apple Corps.

With her distinct five-octave vocal range, prolific songwriting, and producing talent, Carey has defined the modern pop performance. As a singer/songwriter/producer, she has been recognized with five Grammy Awards, nine American Music Awards, Billboard’s “Artist of the Decade” Award,  the World Music Award for “World’s Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium,” and BMI’s “Icon Award” for her outstanding achievements in songwriting, to name a few.\n\nMariah Carey exploded upon the scene with the debut of her self-titled album in 1990, combining angelic allure and a vocal intensity never heard before. The critically acclaimed album spawned an extraordinary four #1 singles. Carey continued her early success with a series of hit singles from her subsequent albums; Emotions (1991) and MTV Unplugged (1992) that would secure her place at the top of the charts and pop culture.\n\nWith the release of Music Box (1993), Carey produced her most commercially successful album selling an astounding 30 million units. In 1994, Carey released the classic holiday album, Merry Christmas which features her original timeless holiday hit “All I want for Christmas is you.” In 1995, Mariah became the second artist in history and the first female performer to have a song debut at #1 with the smash single, “Fantasy” off her hit album, Daydream. \"Fantasy\" helped define a new genre of music with the surprising hit collaboration with rap group Wu-Tang Clan's O.D.B. She produced a second #1 debut single off Daydream with the Boyz II Men collaboration “One sweet day” which subsequently became the 90's song of the decade. She followed with the hip-hop and R&B-infused Butterfly (1997), a natural progression to \"Daydream\", which introduced a new chapter in her career and life, again working with the hottest names in the music business including Sean Combs and Missy Elliott.\n\nIn 1998, eight years after her debut, Carey released #1’s, a compilation of her chart-topping hits. The album also included a new song, “When You Believe” (from the Dreamworks film, The Prince of Egypt), a duet with Whitney Houston that paired two of the most successful female recording artists in pop history. The song went on to win the 1999 Academy Award for “best original song.”\n\n“Heartbreaker,” the first single off of her landmark album, Rainbow (1999) led Carey to become “the first artist to top the charts in each year of the 1990s.” Consequently, the record also pushed her ahead of The Beatles as the artist with the most cumulative weeks spent atop the Hot 100 singles chart. Mariah Carey subsequently sparked the interest of Universal Music Group’s Island Def Jam Records, which signed her to an exclusive recording contract in May 2002. Later that year, she made her label debut with the release of the multi-platinum Charmbracelet.\n\nEvoking a nickname used by those closest to her, The Emancipation of Mimi marked Mariah Carey’s tenth studio album with its release in April of 2005. The album, which features Billboard song of the decade, “We belong together” earned three Grammys following a string of wins at the Vibe Awards, the American Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards. Mimi was the biggest selling album of the year.\n\nIn 2008, the first single off E=MC ², “Touch my body” became Mariah's 18th Billboard #1 single, surpassing the longstanding record for most #1 singles by a solo artist, held by Elvis Presley with 17. To celebrate this monumental achievement, the world famous Empire State building lit the tower in Mariah’s favorite colors, pink yet lavender.\n\nIn the thirteen songs on her spellbinding album, Memoirs of an imperfect Angel, released in 2009, Mariah explored the aspects of our shared humanity with a rare depth, honesty and open-heartedness: it’s one of the strongest statements in her long, distinguished career. With just one exception, Carey wrote and produced the entire album in collaboration with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. Mariah scored another #1 club hit with \"Obsessed,\" the lead single from Memoirs. The video, directed by Brett Ratner was a huge success and a comedic triumph.\n\nMerry Christmas II You, Mariah’s thirteenth studio album and second holiday album was released in November 2010. In addition to traditional yuletide, Merry Christmas II You also contained original songs composed by Mariah, “Oh Santa!” and “All I Want For Christmas Is You” among them. Merry Christmas II You made chart history when Mariah became the first artist to claim the top two spots on Billboard’s Holiday Digital Songs chart, “Oh Santa!” debuting at #1, in front of the new recording of her all-time standard, “All I Want For Christmas Is You” at #2. Mariah rounded out her chart-topping success with a # 1 debut on Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop albums Chart.\n\nMariah Carey's ongoing impact transcends the music industry to leave an indelible imprint upon the world at large. Recently, she’s made a substantial mark in film with her critically acclaimed role as a social worker inPrecious, the 2009 film based on the novelPush by Sapphire.  A Congressional Award recipient, Carey  has generously donated her time and energy to a range of philanthropic causes near to her heart including Save the Music, The Make-A-Wish Foundation, World Hunger Relief, and the Elton John Aids Foundation, among many others. A tremendous supporter of children’s charities, both domestic and international, Mariah Carey, in partnership with the Fresh Air Fund founded Camp Mariah, a retreat for inner city children to explore career development.\n\nMariah is currently in the studio, writing, recording and executive-producing her next album for Island Def Jam Music Group with the lead single \"Triumphant.\"  Carey also made worldwide headlines this summer with the exciting news that she will join the judges’ panel of FOX’s American Idol when the series returns in 2013.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151604213177766","source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/946627_10151604213177766_775801455_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop/R&B","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"New York, New York","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":11030628,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/mariahcarey","name":"Mariah Carey","record_label":"Island","talking_about_count":235625,"username":"mariahcarey","website":"http://www.mariahcarey.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Paramore","id":"5388374962","info":{"id":"5388374962","about":"Paramore's new self-titled album featuring the single 'Still Into You' is available now on Fueled By Ramen.

One of the most accomplished performers of the last decade, she has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide, achieved four #1 singles on the Billboard hot 100 chart, and has won four Grammy Awards and a Latin Grammy Award, as well as two top five albums in the United States. She has collaborated with other great artists including Herbie Hancock, Andrea Bocelli, Sean “Diddy” Combs and most recently, the legendary Tony Bennett. \n\tAfter sweeping the top of the charts with her third album, “Back to Basics,” which debuted at #1 in August ’06 and went on to become the biggest seller in the SoundScan era for a female artist, shipping 3.7 million worldwide, the unstoppable Aguilera announced a 41-city North American tour. With special guests the Pussycat Dolls as openers, the fashion legend Roberto Cavalli as the exclusive costume designer, choreographer and director Jamie King (Madonna, Janet Jackson and Prince) on board, and a unique stage design that allowed fans unprecedented access to the pop star, the shows were a feast for all senses and earned her rave reviews. \n\tBarely catching her breath from this whirlwind, which came at the heels of extensive European dates, Aguilera lent her hand to an entirely new production—an eponymous perfume, which she launched in October ’07 through Procter and Gamble. The heady, fruity fragrance is wild and exotic, sensual and succulent. And its hourglass shaped bottle with coquettish lace trim perfectly reflects its seductive boudoir sensibility. \"I love trying new things in my music and in fashion,” says Christina. “To have a perfume of my own is the beginning of an exciting adventure.” \nBut perfume is hardly her latest creation. In January 2008, Aguilera gave birth to her first child, son Max Liron Bratman.  No doubt mommyhood is the next colorful phase in a life that has included everything from Mouseketeer to MAC spokesperson.\nFollowing the birth, in February 2008 the new mom served as the muse behind London jeweler Stephen Webster’s new sterling silver collection. Christina inspired and fronts the unconventional collection posing as a Hitchcock heroine in the ad campaign.  “Where we took the ads I think, is a really original place. It was fun experimenting with that,” says Christina.\nThe Staten-Island native’s trajectory from performing in local talent shows in Pennsylvania, where she grew up, to getting her big break on “Star Search” in 1992 to landing a part on the Disney Channel’s “The New Mickey Mouse Club”, is well known. It was her song, “Reflection,” for Disney’s “Mulan,” that led to a record deal with RCA and the release of her self-titled debut album in the summer of 1999. The album quickly hit #1 on the strength of its first dance/pop single, “Genie In A Bottle” (which dominated the charts for five weeks) and other chart toppers including “What A Girl Wants.” It was a feat she would repeat the following year with “Mi Reflejo,” the smash Spanish-language version of her debut, followed by her hit holiday release, “My Kind of Christmas.”\nIn 2001 Aguilera joined forces with Pink, Mya and Lil’ Kim on the smash “Lady Marmalade” single and video. That eye-popping slice of eye and ear candy kept her front and center in the international spotlight even as she began, slowly and steadily, to lay the groundwork for her second album, Stripped.  Released in October 2002, it sealed her status as an international superstar while transforming her image from bubble-gum-pop princess to steamy sex kitten. Along with the superheated funk of the album’s provocative debut single, “Dirrty,” came such standout tracks as “Beautiful,” “Can’t Hold Us Down” and “Make Over.”\nEarning her first of four Grammy Awards in 2000 for Best New Artist, her subsequent trophies came in 2001 for “Lady Marmalade” (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals), in 2003 for “Beautiful” (Best Female Pop Vocal Performance) and in 2007 for “Ain’t No Other Man (Best Female Pop Vocal Performance), winning a Grammy for each of her albums. Among countless other honors, she is also the recipient of a 2001 Latin Grammy Award for Mi Reflejo (Best Female Pop Vocal Album), a 2000 Billboard Music Award for Female Artist of the Year, and two 2004 Rolling Stone Music Awards (Best Female Performer, Readers’ Pick; and Best Tour, Readers’ Pick, “Justified and Stripped”).  Voted Sexiest Teen Idol in a VH1 poll, Aguilera’s beauty and charisma have also led Teen People to list her among its “25 Hottest Stars Under 25” and Maxim to crown her Best International Female Singer (2000), one of the Sexiest Women of the Year (2003) and #1 on their “Hot 100” List (2003).  Aguilera has also been honored with two NRJ Awards (Best International Female, Best International Album) as well as a 2007 MTV Europe Award (Best Female Artist).\nToday, while devoting the lion’s share of her time to recording and touring, the 26-year-old is active in a range of philanthropy.  A major contributor to the fight against AIDS, Aguilera has participated in the “What’s Going On?” cover project for AIDS Project Los Angeles’ Artists Against AIDS.  In 2004 she became the new face for MAC cosmetic company and spokesperson for the MAC AIDS Fund.  More recently she became involved in awareness campaigns with Youth AIDS and ALDO.  She also sponsors and is actively involved in the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh for battered women and children.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.christinaaguilera.com\n\nFor more information, please visit www.christinaaguilera.com.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151132698992824","source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/525163_10151132698992824_537758630_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":11444029,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/christinaaguilera","name":"Christina Aguilera","record_label":"RCA","talking_about_count":222958,"username":"christinaaguilera","website":"www.christinaaguilera.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Backstreet Boys","id":"5736008378","info":{"id":"5736008378","about":"The Backstreet Boys | Celebrating 20 Years!

En 1975 decidieron juntarse para tocar distintos temas de grupos a los que admiraban, entre ellos The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Police, entre otros. \nInicialmente, se hacían llamar The Spies of the Green Hat, pero pronto el nombre se abrevió a Green Hat y, finalmente, se adaptó al español como Sombrero Verde, ya que la banda deseaba tocar rock en su propio idioma, siendo de los primeros grupos en aventurarse a componer sus propias canciones aun cuando el rock en español no era una tendencia. \nEn 1981 publicaron su primer disco, Sombrero Verde, con el sello Ariola; los sencillos fueron \"Vampiro\", \"Profesor\", \"Long time\" y \"Despiértate\".\n \nEn 1983 lanzaron A Tiempo de Rock; los sencillos del álbum serían \"Laura\", \"Hechos nada más\" y \"Me voy al mar\". Con esta producción el grupo logró escaso éxito. \n\nEn 1984, Abraham Calleros, baterista del grupo, decide dejar la banda para continuar su carrera musical en Estados Unidos. El grupo decide poner un anuncio en el periódico solicitando un nuevo integrante, gracias a esto encuentran al joven baterista de origen cubano-colombiano nacido en Miami, Alex González, quien a partir de ese momento sería pieza clave de la historia del grupo. \nLa vida de Sombrero Verde continuó hasta 1986, cuando el guitarrista Gustavo Orozco decide también abandonar la agrupación concentrarse en sus estudios académicos. Al quedar de nuevo el grupo como cuarteto, Fher decide cerrar el libro de Sombrero Verde y formar una nueva banda que fusionara el rock, pop y los ritmos latinos.\n \nEn esa época, comenzó en México el movimiento denominado \"Rock en tu idioma\", una estrategia comercial de algunas compañías discográficas encaminada a llamar la atención de los jóvenes para desarrollar música rock en español. La tendencia, importada de Argentina y España, estaba avalada por el trabajo pionero de grupos como Soda Stereo, Enanitos Verdes, Mecano, Nacha Pop, La Unión, Radio Futura, Hombres G y Zas (La banda de Miguel Mateos); como consecuencia de ello, aparecieron varias bandas mexicanas formadas por jóvenes con influencias musicales de grupos norteamericanos y europeos. Surgieron así las bandas líderes del movimiento en México: Caifanes, Maldita Vecindad, Café Tacvba y, entre ellas, Maná, quienes lograrían éxito no solo a nivel local sino también internacionalmente.\n\nManá\n\nEn medio de este naciente movimiento, la banda adoptó el nombre que le daría proyección internacional: «Maná», que fue elegido por el significado que tiene la palabra en polinesio: «energía positiva». La alineación quedó conformada por Fher Olvera como vocalista, los hermanos Ulises y Juán Diego Calleros, en guitarra y bajo respectivamente, y Alex González en la batería.  \n \nEn 1987, el grupo firmó con la discográfica Polygram y publicó Maná, disco que afianzaría el movimiento Rock en tu idioma. De este trabajo se desprendieron los sencillos: “Robot”, “Mentirosa”, “Mueve tus caderas” y “Queremos paz”. Con esta producción el grupo tuvo escaso éxito, y no dejó del todo satisfechos a los integrantes; diversos roces con la disquera por el deseo de mantener la esencia e identidad del grupo, llevaron a Maná a pedir su carta de retiro de Polygram. \n \n\nFalta Amor \n\nCon un futuro incierto el grupo trabaja en nuevos demos y busca una nueva compañía discográfica, logrando firmar con Warner Music México. \nTras la mala experiencia del primer disco, Fher y Alex estaban concientes de los riesgos que implica ponerse en las manos de un productor que no entendía el concepto del grupo ni su propuesta artística, por lo que optaron por iniciarse en un camino del cual no se han apartado desde entonces: asumir ellos la producción de todos sus discos. \n\nCon esa idea en mente graban el álbum Falta Amor (1989), que no obtiene éxito sino hasta un año después de su lanzamiento gracias al sencillo “Rayando el sol”, el cual se convierte en el primer gran éxito para Maná; los sencillos “Perdido en un barco”, “Estoy agotado” y “Buscándola” llegan también al gusto de la gente. \n \nEl grupo realiza 112 presentaciones en México y su primer concierto multitudinario fuera de las fronteras de su país, en el Coliseo General Rumiñahui de Quito, Ecuador. Fue gracias a esta presentación que el grupo se dio cuenta del potencial que la banda podía tener a nivel internacional. \n \n \n¿Dónde Jugarán Los Niños?\n\nEn 1991 Maná enfrenta el primer cambio en su alineación con la salida de Ulises Calleros, quien desde entonces se dedica a representar al grupo. Ello significó la llegada de dos nuevos miembros: el tecladista Iván González y el guitarrista César “El Vampiro” López. Con esa nueva formación graban en Los Ángeles en el año 1992 ¿Dónde Jugarán Los Niños?, álbum que constituye un auténtico parteaguas en la historia del grupo y en la del rock en español, manteniéndose durante 97 semanas en la lista Billboard de los discos más vendidos de Latinoamérica. \n  \nOcho sencillos de esta producción encabezaron las listas de popularidad en toda la América hispanoparlante y se han convertido en temas clásicos de su repertorio: “Vivir sin aire”, “¿Dónde jugarán los niños?”, “De pies a cabeza”, “Como te deseo”, “Oye mi amor”, “Cómo diablos”, “Te lloré un río” y “Me vale”. \n \nLa globalización de Maná inicia en 1993, con una maquinaria promocional de primer nivel y una serie de 268 conciertos en más de 17 países. La gira fue un éxito y posicionó a la banda entre la comunidad latina de Estados Unidos y en mercados como Chile, Ecuador, Perú, Bolivia, Venezuela y Argentina. \n \nArgentina y España, dos territorios históricamente difíciles de alcanzar para artistas latinos no nativos, fueron también conquistados por el fenómeno de Maná gracias a que el tema “Vivir sin aire” alcanzó el primer lugar en las listas de popularidad de ambos países, lo cual no había sucedido en 26 años. Este mismo tema se hace merecedor al premio MTV Latino Video Music Award como mejor video del año. \n \nEn Abril de 1994 y por diferencias artísticas y profesionales, Iván González y César “El Vampiro” López dejan Maná a la mitad de la gira. Por un segundo, el futuro de la banda y su tour estuvo en duda, pero pronto demostraron que la formula de la agrupación y su esencia seguía intacta. Para acabar la gira contrataron a los músicos Juán Carlos Toribio como apoyo en teclados, Gustavo Orozco en guitarra y Sheila Ríos en coros. \n\n \nManá en Vivo\n\nCon su nuevo y bien merecido estatus en la escena del rock pop latino internacional, el trío compuesto por Fher, Alex y Juán lanzaron el disco Maná en Vivo (1994). La idea de lanzar un disco de sus conciertos surge como un medio para capturar la energía y revivir cada momento, cada gota de adrenalina y sudor que forman parte de la magia de las presentaciones de Mana. \nEl disco fue grabado entre Agosto y Septiembre de 1994, durante las presentaciones del grupo en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los Ángeles, la Sports Arena en San Diego, el Aragon Theatre en Chicago, el Teatro Gran Rex en Buenos Aires, el Estadio de Chile en Santiago y la Sala Estándar en Barcelona.\nUna vez más, la revista Billboard los galardonó con el premio al mejor Álbum Rock/Pop del Año. \n\nCuando Los Ángeles Lloran \n\nDeseosos de regresar a su formación original como cuarteto, Maná tiene el tercer y último cambio en su alineación. La banda audiciona a más de 80 guitarristas de México, Argentina, Chile y Estados Unidos, hasta que finalmente en Aguascalientes, México, encuentran al talento que buscaban en Sergio Vallín, cuya sorprendente sensibilidad, técnica y versatilidad vienen a darle un lustre distinto al sonido de las guitarras en las producciones de la banda. Con esa nueva formación  y con demos hechos en Guadalajara y Puerto Vallarta, graban y editan el disco Cuando los Ángeles Lloran (1995) entre Los Ángeles y el puerto jalisciense. Esta producción, lanzada tres años después de su exitoso ¿Dónde Jugarán Los Niños? se distingue por una notable evolución en la lírica y el sonido del grupo. Los sencillos “Déjame entrar”, “No ha parado de llover” y “Hundido en un rincón” no solo representaron un rotundo éxito en la radio, sino que los videos correspondientes tuvieron una gran rotación en los canales de música y ganaron diversos premios por su calidad. \n \nEl disco les permitió una primera nominación al premio Grammy Americano, el más importante en la industria discográfica.\n \nCon el estandarte de un nuevo disco el grupo inicia su nueva gira el 12 de mayo de 1995, con un total de 52 conciertos realizados en 13 países, esto en un período de menos de cinco meses, lo cual mostró el fenómeno que para ese momento ya significaba Maná.\n\nDurante su visita a España en ese mismo año, el grupo se presentó en la plaza de Las Ventas junto a Revolver y La Unión, donde el público recibió a la banda con los brazos abiertos. La gira Cuándo Los Ángeles Lloran significó al grupo presentaciones con sold out completos en cada plaza que visitaban.  \n\nOtros impresionantes logros fueron la inclusión de Maná en el festival de Jazz de Montreaux y la conferencia Midem, que tuvieron lugar en Suiza y Francia, respectivamente, una proeza nunca antes alcanzada. También participan con un tema en la película My Family, a petición del prestigiado director Francis Ford Coppola. \nManá siempre ha expresado su interés en los problemas que el planeta está enfrentando en materia de ecología, por lo que en Septiembre de 1995 crearon la Fundación Ecológica Selva Negra, con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el tema. (www.selvanegra.org.mx)\n \nA mediados de Abril de 1996, el grupo continuó una extensa y esperada gira por toda la República Mexicana.\n \nDurante la segunda mitad de 1996 la banda se aventuró en una gira de 17 conciertos con localidades agotadas en Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, Santa Barbara, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleáns, Sacramento, Miami, San Jose, Phoenix, San Bernardino, Tucson, Anaheim y las Vegas. Dicho tour les valió importantes artículos en prestigiosas revistas como Rolling Stone, Time, Details, People Magazine, Newsweek y Pollstar. \n \nEl 7 de Septiembre de 1996 la banda se presenta dos noches con localidades agotadas en el James Knight Center de Miami, logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda de rock pop latina. La producción le valió al grupo el premio Billboard al Mejor Álbum de Rock/Pop Latino, lo cual fijo un record de 6 premios Billboard recibidos en un período de 3 años. \n \nDespués de sus presentaciones en Estados Unidos la banda regresa a México, donde dan 2 exitosos conciertos  en la Plaza de Toros de su natal Guadalajara. Durante su estadía en dicha ciudad, la banda dio una conferencia de prensa para anunciar el lanzamiento de su website; mientras la conferencia tenía lugar el sitio recibió 6000 entradas, una cifra sorprendente tomando en cuenta la época.\n \nEn Marzo de 1997 la reconocida revista americana especializada en bateristas y la industria de este instrumento, Modern Drummer, publicó un artículo sobre Alex González, en la cual señala a Maná como todo un suceso dentro del rock pop latino en Estados Unidos, a la par de reconocer a Alex como uno de los mejores bateristas a nivel mundial dentro del género. 11 años después, en Marzo de 2008 Alex aparece de nuevo en la revista, pero esta vez en una extensa entrevista.\n \nSueños Líquidos\n\nTras una favorable experiencia de su anterior grabación en Puerto Vallarta, sitio importantísimo en el atlas creativo de Maná, el grupo decide regresar para hacer los demos y la grabación de su próxima producción. Así, con la ambición de crear música en un ambiente donde el agua, elemento vital como pocos, tuviera una presencia contundente, Maná renta una hermosa casa con vista a Bahía de Banderas, en Conchas Chinas, y graban el disco Sueños Líquidos en 1997. \nIncontables atardeceres frente al océano fueron el marco idóneo para concebir  Sueños Líquidos, álbum producido también por Fher y Alex, en colaboración con Benny Faccone. El resultado fue una energética mezcla de rock, pop y ritmos latinos que van desde el bosanova hasta el flamenco, pasando por la cadencia caribeña del reggae. Importantes sencillos como “En el Muelle de San Blás”, “Hechicera”, “Clavado en un bar” y “Como dueles en los labios” se desprenden de esta producción.\n \nEl disco salió al mercado en Octubre de 1997 y fue lanzado simultáneamente en 36 países; debutó en primer lugar en el Billboard Hot Latin 50 Chart.\n\nLa producción sonó fuerte también en la Unión Americana y Maná se convirtió en la primera banda de rock en español que se presentó en El Show de Kathie Lee & Regis, emisión líder de audiencia en la televisión estadounidense. \n \nEl 30 de  Enero de 1998 la banda inició su gira más ambiciosa, Sueños Líquidos World Tour en Chile, para posteriormente visitar Uruguay y México. Tras una pausa de 4 semanas debido a que el baterista, Alex González, fue diagnosticado con hepatitis A, el grupo reanudó la gira por su natal México, donde ofrecieron 44 conciertos.\n\nEntre las presentaciones que destacan en la gira Sueños Líquidos Tour 98 se encuentran las de Bolivia, Colombia, Perú, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Chile, Puerto Rico, Honduras, y El Salvador.  \n\nOtras de las presentaciones más importantes son los conciertos en el Auditorio Nacional, recinto en el que Maná rompió récord, pues fue la primera ocasión en que una banda de este género se presenta siete veces consecutivas sobre este escenario.\n\nDe vital importancia para la carrera de Maná fue ser la primera banda de rock en español firmada por la agencia Creative Artist Agency (CAA), con ello Maná se unía a la importante lista de representados que incluía a Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Depeche Mode, Santana, Bob Dylan, George Michael, entre otros.\n \nSu primer gira de la mano con CAA inició el 21 de agosto de 1998 en Los Ángeles, CA y cubrió más de 30 ciudades con un total de 36 shows en arenas y anfiteatros, la mayoría de ellas con llenos totales. Importantes presentaciones tuvieron lugar en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los Ángeles y en el Rosemont Horizon Arena, donde rompen record al ser el primer grupo de rock pop latino en agotar localidades. \n \nEste tour fue el más grande realizado por un grupo de rock pop latino en Estados Unidos.\n \nLa banda es nominada por sexta vez consecutiva a los premios que otorga la revista Billboard por Sueños Líquidos, dentro del rubro Mejor Álbum Pop Rock del Año, llevándose el cotizado premio.\n \nEn diciembre de 1998, Maná fue nominado por segunda vez  a los Premios Grammy Americanos en la categoría Mejor Álbum Latino de Rock/Alternativo por Sueños Líquidos, premio al que se hicieron merecedores el 24 de febrero de 1999. Este es el primer Grammy otorgado a una banda de rock pop mexicana.\n \nTambién en diciembre de 1998, Fher recibe una invitación por parte de Carlos Santana para participar en su nuevo material discográfico. Fher compone ¨Corazón espinado¨, tema con el cual se abren fronteras para la música latina, tras colocarse este sencillo en los primeros lugares de países europeos, asiáticos, y americanos. La grabación se realizó en las ciudades de Los Ángeles y San Francisco CA, en donde nació una gran amistad entre ambos músicos.\n \nComo resultado de esta colaboración, Alex y Fher reciben el premio Grammy como productores y escritores de dicha canción, además de realizar junto a Santana una gira por Estados Unidos y México. El grupo compartió arenas, auditorios y estadios de la Unión Americana con Carlos Santana, en una extensa gira que daría comienzo el 29 de julio de 1999 en la ciudad de Houston TX, seguida de varias presentaciones por diferentes ciudades de ese estado, para continuar en Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Anaheim, Mountain View, Concord, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Boise, y Denver. Abriría los conciertos el grupo Ozomatli, seguidos de Maná y Carlos Santana alternando el orden de estos en cada una de sus presentaciones. Conciertos históricos se llevan a cabo en el Arrowhead Pond en Anaheim, donde el grupo realiza cuatro shows sold out.\n \nLa combinación de Maná y Carlos Santana dejó sin duda huella en el mercado de rock en español, como uno de los acontecimientos más grandes de la historia del género en los Estados Unidos. En total Maná y Santana habían realizado 43 shows por Estados Unidos, Ciudad de México, Guadalajara, y Monterrey al finalizar la gira en diciembre de 1999. \n \n\nMTV Unplugged\n\nLa cadena de videos MTV llevaba varios años solicitando a Maná su participación en la serie de grabaciones Unplugged, sin que la banda hubiese podido acceder a la petición debido a los compromisos que le significaban sus grabaciones y extensas giras. \nFinalmente se dieron las condiciones para el proyecto, por lo que el 9 de  Marzo de 1999 la banda graba Maná Unplugged en Miami ante un íntimo publico de 70 afortunados fans. En dicho material el grupo incluye éxitos de su repertorio más 3 covers en modalidad acústica; también contiene el interludio musical ¨Coladito¨, duelo de percusión entre Alex Gónzalez y el músico invitado Luís Conte, donde se pude apreciar la destreza de ambos ejecutantes.\n\nEl 22 de Junio de 1999 el material se lanza a la venta simultáneamente en todo el continente americano, alcanzando el primer lugar de ventas en el TOP 50 Latino de la revista Billboard, con lo cual la banda repite la hazaña de ser el único grupo de rock latino en lograrlo. Hasta el momento, este disco sigue siendo uno de los más vendidos para la cadena de televisión, además de que fue el primer artista latino en lanzar un material de este tipo (CD/DVD).\n\nEl primer sencillo que se desprendió de esta producción, tema original de Juan Gabriel, “Se me olvidó otra vez” permaneció durante más de 5 semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar en las listas de radio de gran parte de México y Latinoamérica. “Te solté la rienda”, del compositor José Alfredo Jiménez fue otro exitosísimo sencillo que se desprendió de esta grabación. \n\nA principios de enero del 2000, Maná recibe la noticia de su nominación a los premios Grammy en la categoría de Mejor Álbum de Pop Latino por su disco MTV Unplugged, esta era la tercera vez consecutiva que el grupo estaba nominado a tan afamados premios.\n \nLa banda con muchas ganas de tocar arranca una gira por Sudamérica y el Caribe el 17 de Marzo de 2000, visitando países como Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Puerto Rico y Republica Dominicana; las presentaciones en la capital Argentina lograron un éxito y expectación impresionante, tras ofrecer un concierto en el Estadio Ferro de Buenos Aires a tan solo unas semanas de haber realizado 2 conciertos previos en el Luna Park de esa misma ciudad; lo mismo sucedió en el estadio Santa Laura, en Santiago de Chile. El resto de la gira lució con llenos totales en todos los lugares en donde Maná se presentó.\n\nA mediados del mes de abril en la ciudad de Miami, se celebraron los premios Billboard a la Música Latina, en los cuales Maná recibe 2 premios importantes, el primero al Mejor Álbum de Rock Pop Latino por su producción MTV Unplugged, y el segundo premio para la Fundación Ecológica Selva Negra, denominado Spirit of Hope el cual se entrega únicamente a aquellos artistas que se han destacado por realizar acciones altruistas en pro del medio ambiente y de los derechos humanos.\n\nEn estas mismas fechas el grupo recibe un reconocimiento que por primera vez se les otorga, el premio que concede la cadena de renta y venta de videos y música más grande de los Estados Unidos, el Block Buster Award por Mejor Artista Latino.\n\nEn el mes de Junio Maná comienza su Gira por España y las Canarias en un tour denominado Tourriata, visitando ciudades como:\nTenerife, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Toledo, Santiago, Burgos, Palencia, Zamora, Barcelona, Madrid, Victoria, San Sebastián, Gijon, La Coruña, Elche, San Javier Murcia, Valencia, Sevilla, San Fernando y Málaga.\n\nCabe mencionar que en la capital española, las dos fechas en la plaza de toros Las Ventas fueron llenos totales, lo cual era una hazaña difícil aún para los artistas de origen español, y un logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda o artista latino. En el resto de la gira que realizaron a lo largo y ancho de la Península Ibérica lograron igualmente ventas totales.\n\nEn el mes de septiembre el grupo asiste a la primera entrega del Grammy Latino, en donde junto con Carlos Santana interpretaron el tema “Corazón espinado”, siendo éste unos de los momentos más memorables de la noche. En dicha ceremonia Maná resulto ganador de 3 Grammy por su participación en el álbum del guitarrista.  \n\nDurante su estancia en la ciudad de Los Ángeles, Maná es invitado a interpretar el tema “Corazón espinado” al lado de Carlos Santana en el #1 talk show de los Estados Unidos “The Tonight Show” con  Jay Leno, quien reconoció a Maná como el grupo de rock pop latino más importante.\n\nLa banda no para y lanza el compilatorio titulado Grandes Maná, cuya edición se hizo solamente para Europa y Escandinavia; a escasas semanas de haber salido a la venta ocupó las primeras posiciones de la radio principalmente de la Península Itálica con el tema “En el Muelle de San Blas”. Con este suceso Maná visita en Noviembre del 2001 por primera vez Italia, en una gira promocional en la cual realizan un showcase en Milán para medios de comunicación, personalidades y público en general. Italia adoptó a Maná, la barrera del idioma se rompe y entran directo a los primeros lugares de la radio, apareciendo en las primeras planas de la prensa nacional Italiana.\n\n\n\nRevolución de Amor\n\nA principios de 2002 la banda se encierra para componer y hacer demos de lo que sería su próximo disco de estudio a tres años del lanzamiento de Sueños Líquidos. Lanzan Revolución de Amor en Junio de 2002, disco en él que se muestra la búsqueda de la banda por mezclar su esencia con el sonido de rock de los sesentas y setentas, además de otras fusiones de música latina. El resultado fue una colección de grabaciones completamente energéticas, con un sonido que privilegia el de las guitarras pero que no renuncia a la búsqueda y la fusión. \nEste, su sexto álbum de estudio, fue grabado en su totalidad en Los Ángeles, entre Febrero y Mayo de 2002 y contó con la participación de Carlos Santana y su guitarra en el tema “Justicia, Tierra y Libertad”, así como la de Rubén Blades en “Sábanas frías”. Cabe destacar que el guitarrista del grupo, Sergio Vallín, participó cantando el tema “¿Por qué te vas?”, dedicado a sus padres.\nRevolución de Amor alcanzó  el primer lugar en ventas en España, Latinoamérica y Estados Unidos durante cinco semanas consecutivas. Tuvo como sencillos más destacados “Ángel de amor”, “Eres mi religión” y “Mariposa traicionera”.\n \nGracias al éxito obtenido en Italia, el cantante Zucchero los invita a participar en la canción “Baila morena”, dueto que resulta todo un éxito tanto en América como en Europa. Maná le devuelve el gesto al cantante al invitarlo a participar en la canción “Eres mi religión” pero ahora en italiano, que luego fue incluida en una edición especial del disco Revolución de Amor editado en Europa.\n \nEl 29 de Septiembre de 2002 Maná se aventura a una nueva gira de dos años que los pondría como nunca antes al mercado internacional. La gira llevó al grupo no solo a ciudades de Estados Unidos, México, Latinoamérica y España, sino a nuevas plazas como Roma, Milán, París, Berlín, Eifel, Nuremberg, Munich, Stuggart, Hamburgo, Río de Janeiro y Sao Paolo. \n \nLa primera incursión de la banda en el difícil mercado brasileño se dio con llenos totales; lo mismo sucedió en sus presentaciones en Italia, Francia y Alemania donde alcanzaron un lugar entre los 30 mejores álbumes respecto a ventas. En total, el grupo realizó más de 100 conciertos en 24 países.\n \nDurante su estancia por Europa, la banda participó en el especial Pavarotti & Friends al lado de Zucchero, donde se presentaron con estrellas de la talla de Bono, Eric Clapton, Lionel Ritchie, Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin y Andrea Bocceli. \nManá recibe dos nominaciones en la 4ta entrega de los Grammy Latino que se realizaron en Miami el 3 de Septiembre de 2003, en las categorías de Mejor Ingeniería de Grabación para un Álbum y Mejor Álbum de Rock por un Dúo o Grupo, llevándose esta última presea. \n \n\nEsenciales  Maná\n \nEl 18 de Noviembre de 2003 el grupo, cansado de tantos años de trabajo, decide tomar un año sabático y aprovechan para lanzar los recopilatorios Esenciales en tres versiones: Sol, Luna y Eclipse, que incluyen sus temas más exitosos y otras colaboraciones de la banda, como por ejemplo la versión de “Fool in the rain”, canción original de Led Zeppelin incluida en el tributo Encomium al legendario grupo inglés y donde Maná fue el único artista latino invitado. También se encuentra en la compilación la canción inédita “Te llevaré al cielo”, tema que  se convirtió en todo un éxito, alcanzando rápidamente los primeros lugares de popularidad en radio y video.\nA manera de agradecimiento a sus seguidores, deciden poner a la venta el 12 de Diciembre de 2004 el DVD llamado Acceso Total, el cual incluye imágenes del tour Revolución de Amor (2002-2003) más escenas nunca antes vistas en camerinos, permitiéndole a los fans  tener ‘acceso total’ a la experiencia que vive Maná en sus giras.  \n \n \nAmar es Combatir\nCasi 5 años habían pasado desde el último disco de estudio de la banda, Revolución de Amor,  por lo que ya corrían rumores y especulaciones sobre la separación del grupo. Lo que nadie sabía era que tras su año sabático y desde principios de 2005, Maná se reunió para empezar a componer su séptimo disco de estudio, Amar es Combatir. \n\nEn Febrero de 2006 la banda decide viajar a Miami, ciudad siempre vibrante, abrazada por el ambiente tropical y con una esencia latina que se respira en el aire, comunión idónea para inspirar la grabación de este CD en el que la banda llevó a cabo una fusión de rock, pop, música latina, reggae, hasta drum and bass. Producido por Fher y Alex, al igual que sus discos anteriores, Amar es Combatir fue lanzado el 22 de agosto de 2006 y es editado en 40 países alrededor del mundo, alcanzando el número 4 en el Top 200 Álbumes de la revista Billboard en los Estados Unidos, récord solamente alcanzado para una producción enteramente en español por el álbum Fijación Oral Vol. 1 de Shakira.\n \nSu primer sencillo, “Labios compartidos”, permanece durante ocho semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar de los charts latinos de radio y es nombrado entre los medios latinos más reconocidos de la unión Americana como uno de los tracks más escuchados y premiados del 2006. \n \nLos sencillos que le siguieron, “Bendita tu luz” (a dúo con Juán Luis Guerra) y “Manda una señal” se posicionan también en el primer lugar de las listas de popularidad. A estos se agregaría un quinto sencillo, “El rey tiburón”, lo cual es un logro a destacar ya que es cada vez menos frecuente que de una producción se desprendan 5 sencillos, dada la complicada situación por la que atraviesa la industria. \n \nEn noviembre de 2006 el grupo participa en la 7ma edición del Grammy Latino, donde además de actuar junto a Juán Luis Guerra con un excelente performance de sus éxitos, que les valió una sentida ovación de parte de los asistentes al evento y que fue uno de los momentos clímax de la velada, reciben un homenaje por su trayectoria artística y logros en la música. \n \nEn febrero de 2007 y tras recibir 5 nominaciones a los premios Billboard Latino, 4 nominaciones a los premios Lo Nuestro y una al Grammy Americano como Mejor Álbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, Maná inicia su gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour, con la mayor producción que haya tenido el grupo hasta el momento (más de 60 toneladas de equipo), la cual los llevaría a dar 116 conciertos durante un período de un año y medio. \n \nLos conciertos de Maná en Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico, incluyeron shows en ciudades como San Diego, Los Ángeles, Laredo, Houston, Corpus Christi, Miami, Orlando, Nueva York, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta y San Juán de Puerto Rico. Maná se convierte en la primera banda de rock pop en español en llenar por tres noches (dos consecutivas) el Madison Square Garden de Nueva York. Destacan también sus cuatro conciertos sold out consecutivos en el Staple Center de Los Ángeles, tres noches sold out en el Miami American Airlines Arena, tres más en el Toyota Center de Houston y cuatro sold out en el Coliseo José M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico. \nAdemás de reunirse en Washington D.C. con la senadora estadounidense  Hillary Clinton para compartir opiniones sobre el medio ambiente y migración, Maná recibe un reconocimiento por las más de 450,000 descargas de su ringtone “Labios compartidos”.\n\nSu gira por Latinoamérica incluyó conciertos en Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Panamá, Venezuela, Colombia, Perú, Brasil y República Dominicana. El grupo tocó en grandes foros, de los cuales destacan los conciertos del grupo en Argentina: tres presentaciones en el Estadio Velez de Buenos Aires así como en el Estadio Chateau Carrera de Córdoba, el Estadio Central en Rosario y el Estadio Malvinas en Mendoza.\nOtras presentaciones de gran relevancia fueron: \nEstadio Defensores del Chaco en Asunción, Estadio del Ejército en Guatemala, Estadio Mágico en San Salvador, Estadio de Futbol de Managhua, Estadio Olímpico de Caracas, el Parque Simón Bolívar en Bogotá, Estadio Alberto Spencer en Guayaquil, Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa en Quito, Estadio Alejandro Serrano en Cuenca, Credicard Hall en Sao Paulo, Citibank Hall en Rio de Janeiro, Estadio Gigantinho en Porto Alegre y el Estadio Quisquella en Santo Domingo.\nDurante Junio y Julio  de 2007 llevan su gira a España, donde rompen records al posicionarse como el artista latino de mayor convocatoria en la madre patria, al vender todas las localidades para sus conciertos en  15 provincias: Zaragoza, Pamplona, Bilbao, Gijón, Santiago, León, Barcelona, Madrid, Murcia, Alicante, Albacete, Málaga, Sevilla, Las Palmas y Tenerife.\n \nCabe destacar la nominación del grupo en los premios World Music Awards, realizados en Mónaco, Francia. Este premio se entrega de acuerdo a las ventas que un artista logró durante un año y donde Maná compartió escenario al lado de artistas como Celine Dion, Avril Lavigne, Rihanna, Patty Labelle, entre otros.  \n\nEntre los premios más destacados que la banda obtuvo por esta producción se encuentra un Grammy Americano en el rubro de Mejor Álbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, 3 galardones Lo Nuestro por Álbum de Rock del Año, Artista Rock del Año y canción Rock del Año; 2 Billboard Latinos por Álbum Rock Alternativo del Año y tema Pop Airplay del Año de Dúo o Grupo. \n\n\nArde El Cielo\n\nLa impresionante respuesta que tuvo la gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour fue una experiencia sorprendente para la banda, por lo que decidieron capturar esa energía, esa adrenalina, en una grabación con la cual sus seguidores pudieran recordar y revivir esos momentos. Así, la banda decide grabar dos de sus cuatro presentaciones en el Coliseo José M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico en Marzo de 2007. \n\nEl 29 de Abril del mismo año Maná presenta en Los Ángeles el CD/DVD llamado Arde el Cielo, el cual fue grabado durante el Amar Es Combatir World Tour. \n\nEl material contiene 12 temas en directo que representan y repasan la historia de Maná, desde “Rayando el sol” a “Labios compartidos”, pasando por “El rey” y canciones tan conocidas como “En el Muelle de San Blas\" o “Vivir sin aire”, así como dos temas inéditos grabados en estudio. El primero de estos temas inéditos es \"Si no te hubieras ido\", una canción de Marco Antonio Solís ya versionada por otros artistas pero en la que Maná supo poner su peculiar sello.\nEl segundo tema inédito del CD es \"Arde el cielo\" un tema compuesto por Fher y producido en conjunto con Álex González. Ambos temas serian hits en 2008. \n \nLos premios Billboard Latinos reconocieron esta producción otorgándole al grupo 4 galardones en las categorías de Canción Del Año por Grupo o Duo y  Tema Pop Airplay del Año por “Si no te hubieras ido”, Album Pop de Año por Grupo o Dúo y Álbum de rock Alternativo del Año por Arde el Cielo. \n \n Actualmente el grupo se encuentra grabando en la ciudad de Miami lo que será su próximo disco.

It’s a good instinct to have. Without it, this Vancouver-based musician would never have left her Mission, B.C. hometown for the life of a singer-songwriter -- a career that’s so far produced an acclaimed debut album (2008’s Tug of War), a MuchMusic Video Award nomination, two gold-certified singles (“Bucket,” “Tug of War”) and -- to top it all -- two 2010 Juno Award nominations for Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year.\n\nShe also wouldn’t have Curiosity. That’s her new record, a collection of heart-on-sleeve pop songs about, fittingly enough, life’s biggest curiosity -- love, and all the complications that come with it. Its sound -- a blend of confessional lyrics, sweet acoustic gems and straight-up pop -- is just as strangely fascinating, not least of all to Carly herself. How she stumbled upon one of its main inspirations is still something of a wonder.\n\nShe was doing what she does – writing music – when something truly curious sneaked up on her. That thing was a song called – what else? – “Curiosity.” Like much of her new album, it was crafted with long-time collaborator, writer/producer Ryan Stewart, and it’s about a girl (“or me,” she laughs) hung up on a bad boy, a guy she knows is no good, but she’ll never stop thinking about. The subject is a universal push-and-pull, one the singer-songwriter even tackled on “Tug of War” (a tune that went on to beat the likes of Nickelback to win the 2010 Canadian Radio Music Award for Song of the Year). But “Curiosity” came rushing out differently, with pop and snap and a bubblegum chorus harder to shake than the bad-boy she’s crowing about.\n\n“I was singing it in the mic, to demo it out, with these guts that I didn’t know I had. And it was exciting. It was like a braver version of me that I never had experimented with before, at least not out loud to people,” she says.\n\nCarly didn’t know what to do about the new song. It felt so natural. She thought about it constantly -- at home in Vancouver, while doing a promotional tour of Japan, and then back again. For eight months, she and Ryan wrestled with it. She wondered: “How would this fit on my record?”\n\nSure, she’s always spinning the likes of La Roux, Kimbra and Dragonette on her stereo, but this is a girl whose roots are in folk. As a little girl, her dad would sing her to sleep with James Taylor classics. As a fledgling musician she ran an acoustic night at a Vancouver cafe. Even during her 2007 run on Canadian Idol she was auditioning with her own material and covering Janis Ian. And then there were all the songs she’d promised herself she’d showcase on album No. 2 -- jangly and cozy folk-pop creations more Natalie Imbruglia than Kylie Minogue.\n\nThose tunes are still there in force (just look to “Europe” or “Alice in Wonderland”). Still, Carly decided that when it came to “Curiosity,” it was love. Pop had just as much a place on her record as folk. Ryan was just as “stoked” about the song as she was -- and so, the real fun began.\n\nThe songs rushed out, a whole 35 of them written -- with most of the record made at Ryan’s Wine Cellar Studios in Vancouver, then mixed by Dave “Rave” Ogilvie (David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, Jakalope) at Mushroom Studios. And Carly’s friends and family were along for the whole process, the singer inviting them to listening sessions -- baiting them with new tunes and fresh popcorn -- so they could help her pick the sweetest of the bunch.\n\n“Talk to Me” finds the 25-year-old getting her flirt on in a summer song clicking with handclaps. “Dear Julien” -- which brought Carly together with co-writer Kevin James Maher -- finds the singer in a more serious mood, writing a letter (and a song) to an ex. On the flip, “Just a Step Away” is, to Carly, the definition of a “beautiful old fashioned love song” -- a piece she adapted from a tune her father wrote for her step-mom on their wedding day. (“He cried and loved it and it was so sweet,” she says.)  \n\n“Both Sides Now,” Carly’s modern cover of the Joni Mitchell classic, bridges the styles she’s embraced on Curiosity. “It’s exactly the combination that I’m hoping is the theme of the album,” says the self-described “flower child of pop.” “I was definitely thinking Joni Mitchell meets dance,” she says of the album’s sonic palette with a giggle. “That’s exactly what I want this record to be.”\n\nAnd then there’s lead single “Call Me Maybe,” the hit that pulses with the same jumpy energy as a new romance -- the very thing Carly’s singing about. It’s a track that reunited Carly with her “Sour Candy” duet partner, old friend and tour-mate Josh Ramsay of Marianas Trench.\n\n“He was so stoked. He’d been trying to get me on the pop train for years,” she laughs. Since debuting in September, the single has been picked up by radio stations across the country. It started out as one of “a gazillion” song ideas Carly and her long-time guitarist Tavish Crowe are always tinkering on, but when Josh turned up to add his writing and production magic, the piece was completely transformed. “I showed it to Josh and in no time he added crazy amounts of Josh genius to make it sound pop and I had no idea how he had done it.”\n\nAnd “Call Me Maybe” shares something with every other song on Curiosity. Underneath the occasional wash of kick-drum and synth, these are all songs sung from the heart. “It’s just me on my guitar in my bedroom writing journal entries,” Carly says of her creative process. “Everything is true for me in this,” she explains. “You can’t sing about love if you haven’t felt it, and you can’t sing about hurt if you haven’t experienced that, too. It’s almost not fair to your audience.\n\n“That’s probably why when I listen back to the record, it’s all about love and chaos and those fun messes,” she says. And what could be more curious than that?\n","booking_agent":"Colin Lewis at The Agency Group","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151400617556048","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/923182_10151400617556048_1267750440_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Vancouver, BC","description":"twitter.com/carlyraejepsen\nwww.carlyraemusic.com\nmyspace.com/carlyraemusic\n\nFor Booking Inquiries contact Colin Lewis @ The Agency Group\n\nManagement: www.simkinartistmanagement.com","general_manager":"Simkin Artist Management","genre":"Pop / Soul / Folk","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Mission, BC","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":6095867,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Carlyraejepsen","name":"Carly Rae Jepsen","press_contact":"Sara Milne / Universal Music Canada","record_label":"604 Records / Universal Music Canada","talking_about_count":207926,"username":"Carlyraejepsen","website":"www.twitter.com/carlyraejepsen www.carlyraemusic.com www.myspace.com/carlyraemusic","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Black Eyed Peas","id":"58332338082","info":{"id":"58332338082","about":" \"#thatPOWER\" with will.i.am feat. Justin Bieber available on iTunes now: http://smarturl.it/ThatPower","app_id":"0","band_members":"will.i.am\nfergie\napl.de.ap\ntaboo","bio":"THE BLACK EYED PEAS\nTHE E.N.D.\n\nThey are the best selling hip-hop group in music today, having sold over 26 million albums worldwide. In fact, they are one of the planet's most popular artists, and have toured more countries than any other artist.\nwill.i.am is not only the group's lead MC and its creative engine, but also an fashion designer, actor, social activist, and incredibly sought-after producer who has worked with everyone from U2 to Nas to Flo Rida.\nThe group's singing sensation, Fergie, has, in just a few short years, evolved into an actress, spokeswoman and fashion icon.\nTaboo and apl.de.ap, who started the group with will.i.am in the early ‘90s, have served as cultural ambassadors and have extended their hands into the worlds of acting and philanthropy. And together, the four parts of The Black Eyed Peas have grown the group into an unparalleled story of accomplishment.\nBut now, the moment has come for The E.N.D.\nNo, it is not time for The Black Eyed Peas to call it quits. The E.N.D. is The Energy Never Dies, the fifth studio album from the Los Angles-based quartet, and the group's most adventurous-sounding effort to date. It is an album that has the unmistakable club bounce and playful lyrical fervor fans have come to expect from the Black Eyed Peas. But it is also an album inspired by the underground world of electro and rock-infused house music, artists like Boyz Noize and DJ David Guetta (who both appear on The E.N.D.), Justice and A-Trak, and a world populated by raucous, all-night dance parties that are bubbling right now in every major city around the globe.\nThe end is more than just a new sound for BEP, says will.i.am. He describes the album's title as not about anything ending at all, but about the transformation of energy at a time of change. \"We are in the middle of a really defining time right now,\" he says. \"It's the end of the traditional era of how we experience and consume music and media.It's the end of the stereotype that we could never have a black President. It's the end of the usual ways of receiving information. But it's also the beginning of a whole new cultural birth.  So the title, The E.N.D. is not just about a new Black Eyed Peas sound but a celebration that change is happening.\nThe energy that pulses through The E.N.D. was born from will.i.am's fascination with the sound of underground dance clubs in his native Los Angeles - parties like LAX and weekly jams at places like Cinespace that host DJs like Crookers, Steve Aoki and others. When he went to Australia in 2008 to shoot a role in the box office hit, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he discovered that the sound he enjoyed in Los Angeles was actually a shared worldwide experience, and that the culture reveled in the vitality of good music, not on any the pretenses of who was cool or not.\n\"It kinda turned my sh** inside out, to be honest,\" will says.Taboo, one of the group’s lead MCs, immediately responded to the energy pulsing through the sound. \"It really reminded me of the days when we were just b-boys growing up in Los Angeles, and the people of that scene were so welcoming to having us be a part of it,\" Taboo says.\"It's really no different from where hip-hop started, if you think about it - it's just party music,\" will says. \"Sugarhill Gang was four-on-the-floor dance music, rapping over disco. Bambaataa used Kraftwerk for the foundations of hip-hop as we know it.\"The group became genuinely immersed in the scene, \"going out five or six nights a week to the different clubs and DJing the parties and dancing with the people and becoming a part of it,\" Taboo describes.\nThey knew inherently, too, that despite being one of the biggest artists in the world (and perhaps because of it), they needed to earn the respect of the people who populated this world. \"It feels good to fight for people to respect your artistry, and appreciate what you do,\" says will. \"It's not supposed to be handed to you on a silver platter; you're supposed to fight for it.\"\nIf the sound of The E.N.D. was inspired by the underground dance scene, then the album itself unfurls like one extended DJ set.\nThere is a pulsating energy and playfulness that transcends throughout, from the old-school electro-hip-hop sound of \"Rock That Body\" (co-produced by French DJ, David Guetta) to the back-and-forth energy between will.i.am apl.de.ap and Fergie on the song  On \"Electric City,\" a deep undercurrent of Jamaican dub and dancehall meets 3008 electro. \"I begged will not to write it without me when I heard the track,\" Fergie says. \"I was still shooting (Nine) and I begged him. I instantly clicked with that track. Fergie is most excited about performing \"I Gotta Feeling,\" which will be the group's second single. The song captures the pinnacle moments of a party, when nights kick into high gear. \"It's a party anthem and all we want to do is wile out,\" she laughs.\nContinually crafting new takes on The Black Eyed Peas sound is a part of the band's DNA and is evident throughout their entire discography. It's helped them become one of the rare hip-hop acts that can straddle the worlds of hip-hop and pop. The first single from The E.N.D., \"Boom Boom Pow,\" a refined, high-energy club-rap track, became the group's first single to ever top the Billboard 100 singles chart and was #1 for 9weeks, and its remixes featuring 50 Cent, Gucci Mane and Kid Cudi electrified the hip-hop blog world.\nMost recently, their album, Monkey Business, birthed two Grammy awards (Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group), and five Grammy nominations. It brought the group's total number of Grammys to three.\nSince those days after the release of Monkey Business, each of the members have taken the time to have their own adventures, which has helped them grow as individuals. will.i.am., not only ventured out into acting (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) but also released a solo album (Songs About Girls), produced for Michael jackson, U2 and helped make Flo Rida a rap star. Then there was his inspired creation of \"Yes We Can,\" the viral video and song that helped focus the cultural momentum of youth voters behind then-candidate Barack Obama. The track won an Emmy in 2008 and many observers cite the viral video (one of the most watched clips in YouTube history) as a sea change in the election.\nFergie rode the momentum of her multi-platinum solo album, The Dutchess and blossomed into a fashion and style icon. She also recently shot a role in the movie, Nine (the character Saraghina), with Daniel Day-Lewis, Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz. \"Singing in character and not as myself was so freeing,\" she says of the experience. \"It took all the pressure off that I usually put on myself.\"\nDuring his time away from BEP, apl.de.ap dedicated himself to both the creative and cultural. He played a role in an independent movie (Subject: I Love You) to whet his appetite for the film world. He also spent a lot of time in the Philippines, his homeland, and embraced a role as an Ambassador of Tourism for the island nation. apl also started the apl Foundation, which helps children in need throughout communities in the Philippines. \"The kind of experiences I had helped me really grow as a person as much as it did an artist,\" he says.\nTaboo, meanwhile, followed a path that was rewarding to him as an artist and as a family man. He acted in two movies (Cosmic Radio, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li) drawing on his extraordinary physical gifts as a dancer and martial arts practitioner for each role. More importantly, he felt he needed to re-dedicate himself to his family life after spending many years traveling around the world with BEP. He got more involved with his 15-year old son, Joshua, and married his longtime girlfriend last July. The couple are also expecting a child. \"To find that part of you that allows you to be a proud parent and to embrace a life of having love all around you, it's been a dream,\" he says.\nThe Black Eyed Peas have been so creatively consistent precisely because they recognize the importance of being able to step away and gain new life experiences. And something special happens when the four members come back together. When it came time to making The E.N.D., they found themselves inspired to make music together again. \"There was this feeling of excitement and a joy the guys and I had in getting back together in the studio again,\" Fergie says. \"I think The E.N.D. sounds like a party record because all we wanted to do when we saw each other was to have fun. We were inspired by the moment and the 'now' without having to look back.\"The ground beneath all is changing, in every facet of our lives, and The Black Eyed Peas have a grasp on it, musically, creatively and socially. And it shows that The E.N.D. isn't really the end at all.\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151656174048083","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/934949_10151656174048083_157206778_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop/Hip-Hop","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":41238978,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/blackeyedpeas","name":"Black Eyed Peas","record_label":"Interscope Records","talking_about_count":206543,"username":"blackeyedpeas","website":"http://www.blackeyedpeas.dipdive.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Paula Fernandes","id":"433953520005784","info":{"id":"433953520005784","about":"Fan Page oficial da cantora Paula Fernandes atualizada pela própria cantora e por sua equipe.","app_id":"0","band_interests":"Twitter: @PaulaFernandes7\nInstagram: @PaulaFernandes77","bio":"Cantora e compositora, Paula Fernandes, nasceu em Sete Lagoas, em Minas Gerais.

She knew where she was headed very early so she started voice coaching at the tender age of 8.\nTowards the end of 2007, Inna met with the guys from Play&Win and changed the history of dance music as we knew it. Inna's popularity and the impact of her first single - “HOT”, brought her the Platinum Record. In 2010, as Inna became a household name and her music a fixture in the clubs, “HOT” spread all over Europe, the single receiving airplay in Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovakia, Greece, Belgium and The Netherlands and reaching the first position in the U.K. Dance Charts. In March 2010, “HOT” also brought INNA the Platinum Record. It was then only a matter of time for the song “Amazing” to go straight to number one in several territories as well, and thus the story kept on going, as all her other singles from her first album, “Love”, “Deja-Vu” and “Sun is Up” became hits.\n2011 came along with numerous awards and nominations, including ones at the MTV European Music Awards, the European Border Breakers Award for her international success and Golden Discs awarded in front of more than 17.000 people, on the scene of Starfloor Paris, in France, where she had the opportunity of singing on the same scene as Kylie Minogue, Bob Sinclar, Taio Cruz, Kelly Rowland and Kat Deluna. But more than that, 2011 also came along with a new album, “I Am The Club Rocker”, released in september, and a world wide tour that included Mexico and the U.S..\nBy the end of the year, INNA also introduced a new live performance concept - “Rock The Roof”. The first session was launched on the 1st of December, to celebrate Romania's National Day, but it got the attention and appreciation of INNA's fans from all over the world. Thus, in 2012, INNA, alongside her band, performed live on the roofs of buildings from one of the largest cities in the world – Paris, Mexico City, London and Istanbul, gathering a total of over 12 million views on her You Tube channel.\nAt the beginning of this spring, INNA released her third album, “Party Never Ends”, and it seems to be one of her fans' favorite. Her latest single, “More than Friends”, a featuring with Daddy Yankee, is already number one in Argentina and aired on radios in Mexico, Japan, Puerto Rico, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Germany, Spain, Turkey and France, as it appears to be one of this upcoming summer's hottest hits.\nHot, lovely and amazing INNA is not just a deja vu success story. It’s a fresh and surprising one and the best is yet to come, as the world is big, the clubs are waiting and THE PARTY NEVER ENDS.\n","birthday":"10/16/1986","booking_agent":"booking@innaofficial.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152718962365381","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/s720x720/7997_10152718962365381_1837531261_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Bucharest","general_manager":"Stefan Lucian","genre":"Dance Music","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Neptun","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8547818,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Inna","location":{"street":"","city":"Bucharest","state":"","country":"Romania","zip":""},"name":"Inna","personal_interests":"Music, Entertainment, Movies","press_contact":"Anamaria Hancu - anamaria.hancu@inna.ro","record_label":"Global Music Management","talking_about_count":192922,"username":"Inna","website":"http://www.innaofficial.com http://twitter.com/inna_ro http://youtube.com/user/Inna","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Guns N' Roses","id":"10901008068","info":{"id":"10901008068","about":"http://www.gunsnroses.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Axl Rose, Dj Ashba, Tommy Stinson, Dizzy Reed, Bumblefoot, Chris Pitman, Richard Fortus, Frank Ferrer ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151053577553069","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/487993_10151053577553069_1943903113_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","genre":"Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":21756467,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/gunsnroses","name":"Guns N' Roses","record_label":"Black Frog","talking_about_count":191382,"username":"gunsnroses","website":"http://www.gunsnroses.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"A.R.

","app_id":"0","bio":"Elvis Aaron Presley, in the humblest of circumstances, was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. He and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1948, and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. \n\nElvis’ musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he frequently attended, and the black R&B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, he began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation. With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture.\n\nHe starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record-breaking, live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 150 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards and accolades were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36, and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees. Without any of the special privileges his celebrity status might have afforded him, he honorably served his country in the U.S. Army.\n\nHis talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions, as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Elvis died at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977.\n\nHouse Rules\n \nThe Elvis Facebook page is intended to be a fun space for you and other Elvis fans.

Refusing to be mere entertainers, the Los Angeles quartet relentlessly challenged, confronted and inspired their fans, leaping headfirst into the heart of darkness while other bands warbled about peace and love.  Though they've had scores of imitators, there's never been another band quite like them.  And 40 years after their debut album, The Doors' music and legacy are more influential than ever before.\n\nMorrison's mystical command of the frontman role may be the iconic heart of The Doors, but the group's extraordinary power would hardly have been possible without the virtuosic keyboard tapestries of Ray Manzarek, the gritty, expressive fretwork of guitarist Robby Krieger and the supple, dynamically rich grooves of drummer John Densmore. From baroque art-rock to jazz-infused pop to gutbucket blues, the band's instrumental triad could navigate any musical territory with aplomb - and all three contributed mightily as songwriters.\n\t\t\t\nThe group was born when Morrison and Manzarek - who'd met at UCLA's film school - met again, unexpectedly, on the beach in Venice, CA, during the summer of 1965.  Though he'd never intended to be a singer, Morrison was invited to join Manzarek's group Rick and the Ravens on the strength of his poetry.  Krieger and Densmore, who’d played together in the band Psychedelic Rangers, were recruited soon thereafter; though several bassists auditioned of the new collective, none could furnish the bottom end as effectively as Manzarek's left hand.  Taking their name from Aldous Huxley's psychotropic monograph The Doors of Perception, the band signed to Elektra Records following a now-legendary gig at the Whisky-a-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip.\n\nTheir eponymous first album, released in January 1967, kicked off with \"Break on Through (to the Other Side)\" and also featured the chart smash \"Light My Fire\", the scorching \"Back Door Man\" and the visionary masterpiece \"The End\".  The Doors arrived fully formed, capable of rocking the pop charts and the avant-garde with one staggering disc.  Before '67 was over, they'd issued the ambitious follow-up Strange Days, with such gems as \"Love Me Two Times\", \"People\nAre Strange\" and \"When the Music's Over\".\n\nNext came 1968's Waiting for the Sun, boasting \"Hello, I Love You\", \"Love Street\" and \"Five to One\".  Over the next few years they minded over new territory on such albums as 1969's The Soft Parade (featuring \"Touch Me\" and \"Tell All the People\"), 1970's Morrison Hotel (which includes \"Roadhouse Blues\", \"Peace Frog\" and \"Queen of the Highway\") and 1971's L.A. Woman (boasting \"Rider's on the Storm\", \"Love Her Madly\" and the title track).\n\nThey released six studio albums in all, as well as a live album and a compilation, before Morrison's death in 1971.  their electrifying achievements in the studio and onstage were unmatched in the annals of rock; and though Morrison's death meant the end of an era, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore collaborated on two more original Doors albums, Other Voices and Full Circle, and a set of tracks they composed to accompany Morrison's 1969 recording of his poetry, released in 1978 as An American Prayer.  They also pursued individual music projects, books, theatrical productions and other enterprises - and remain restlessly creative to this day.\n\nIn the decades since the Doors' heyday, the foursome has loomed ever larger in the pantheon of rock - and they remain a touchstone of insurrectionary culture for writers, activists, visual artists and other creative communities.

Only a year on from their huge Number One debut single ‘All Time Low’ and they have already become one of Britain’s biggest, most brilliant pop bands, living a dream that has far surpassed even their most optimistic expectations and all with their best mates at their side. Hard working and quite plainly loving every single second, the band have already notched up four anthemic Top Five singles and two Number Ones, been viewed a staggering 30 million times on YouTube views and sold 400,000 copies of their eponymous debut album, which shook pop music to its core upon its release last October. A year on and The Wanted are now set to shake up the charts all over again with their feverishly- anticipated second album, a euphoric widescreen classic of epic-pop proportions.\nIt comes at the end of simply phenomenal 2011, a year that has seen The Wanted become serious pop players. With their ferociously infectious tunes, rock solid friendship and laddish charms, they have stamped all over the typical boy band mould and brought a blast of much-needed fresh air to British pop music. The accolades have followed accordingly: The ‘Best British Single’ Brit Award nomination for ‘All Time Low’ in February. The sell-out nationwide ‘Behind Bars’ Tour in March/April. A deal with prestigious American label Def Jam in April. Slots at the iTunes and V festivals in July and August, with 15,000 hollering revellers packing out the Big Blue Tent at V for a set many agreed was a highlight of the festival. All this from a band who started out paying their dues performing in somewhat dodgy nightclubs and a school tour that took them across the whole of the UK. Most significantly of all, the five piece even found time over summer to move out of their two adjoining flats in South London – where they lived in ‘Friends’-style harmony with Jay’s pet lizard Neytiri – and now each live alone, ten minutes apart, while Max is currently house hunting with his new fiancée, Coronation Street’s Michelle Keegan. “Basically, we’ve just grown up,” smiles Max.\nThe change is evident in their sound too: this time round, The Wanted have distilled the dance floor thrills currently defining planet pop and added their own deliciously unique twist. Combining the cinematic melodies of second generation Take That with their own personal musical influences, it is an album that sounds like an immediate classic, yet is also one very much of the moment. But what else would you expect from a band who sounds a bit like Coldplay on ‘All Time Low’ yet covered Example’s rave-pop masterpiece ‘Kickstarts’ as a b-side?\nCertainly, ‘Battleground’ is the sound of a real pop band exploding into ecstatic maturity, recorded in both the UK (at producer Steve Mac’s studio in London) and the U.S.A, at singer/songwriter Diane Warren’s L.A studios overlooking the Hollywood sign. “She’s an evil genius,” laughs Jay, “and also the most ‘real’ person we met out there.”\nThe lads have pooled a spectrum of production wizards: from Xenomania’s Brian Higgins (Girls Aloud, Pet Shop Boys, Kylie) to their long-term collaborative “dream team” Steve Mac (JLS, Ronan Keating, Leona Lewis), Wayne Hector (Cheryl Cole, Britney Spears, The Wanted’s ‘All Time Low’) and Ed Drewett, to acclaimed singer/ song-writer Jack McManus (sometime collaborator with Groove Armada).\nMost tellingly of all, the band have found the confidence to put their own stamp on the writing and production too, allowing the album to reflect what they – five young men who are almost giddily passionate about music – are listening to right now.\n“With the first album we were more involved than I ever thought we would be but this time round we’ve co-written on nearly every single track or written it - the lyrics, music, everything,” beams a clearly chuffed Jay. “Obviously music changes year by year and we’ve incorporated what sounds good to us right now. So there are elements we wouldn’t have had before. There’s grungy dub-step pop, some of it’s really dark, some of it’s just massive.”\nAll of it is world-class contemporary pop music. The two singles we know already: electro rave thriller ‘Gold Forever’ (recorded for Comic Relief, No.3 in March 2011) and the monster Europop summertime No.1, ‘Glad You Came’, which Jay says was the moment “we could feel things changing for us, getting bigger”. On a promotional radio tour, adds Max, they saw screens flashing messages from the public, “saying ‘oh my God, that’s the song of the summer’”. Since its release, The Wanted fever has undoubtedly stepped up a gear. With their feel-good anthems finding equal favour on both dancefloors and radio playlists, they are unequivocally the band of the moment.\nProving that beyond all doubt is ‘Battleground’ which is quite possibly the pop album of the year. From the exhilarating electro-pop of ‘Invincible’ to the tormented strings of 'Warzone' and the throbbing electronics of ‘Mad Man’, the album twists unexpectedly between both the epic and atmospheric and the sheer euphoria of their own brand of future-pop, best summed up in astonishing new single ‘Lightning’. Lyrically, the lads have also progressed, this time taking in the bliss and the treachery of romantic relationships in equal measures. “It’s not just I love you and you love me,” notes Tom. “There’s real stuff in there.”\nIt’s the clearest sign yet that The Wanted now have world domination firmly within their grasp. This autumn, they’ll take a step closer to realising that possibility when they support the most famous teenager on Earth, Justin Bieber, on his sell-out South American tour which includes a show for 120,000 fans in Sao Paulo in October. Self-confessed fan Justin personally requested The Wanted join him on the road after the band supported the Canadian pop titan at London’s 02 Arena in March 2011. “The Brazilian fans,” Jay has heard, “are already going mental.” “We’re having to get two extra security personnel!” thrills Siva. “And get a van with bullet-proof windows!” marvels Nathan. And that’s just\nthe start. In early 2012, The Wanted then embark on their inaugural U.K Arena tour culminating at London’s 02 Arena in March, before jaunts across America, Europe and Australia. It goes without saying, they simply can’t wait to get started. This is everything they have worked for and everything they hoped for, and it’s turning out to be more fun than even they imagined.\n“In the end I wanna look back on all this and say, I’ve travelled the world with these boys,” notes the huge-eyed Max, rather sweetly. “And not only have I made friends for life, we’ve done something that hardly anyone gets to do. Be successful in music worldwide. And I know I will never forget that.”","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151599245439275","source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/931160_10151599245439275_1409520688_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"UK","genre":"Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"London","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4075523,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/TheWanted","name":"The Wanted","record_label":"Island (UK)","talking_about_count":158267,"username":"TheWanted","website":"www.thewantedmusic.com www.youtube.com/thewantedmusic www.twitter.com/thewantedmusic www.twitter.com/JayTheWanted www.twitter.com/NathanTheWanted www.twitter.com/TomTheWanted www.twitter.com/SivaTheWanted www.twitter.com/MaxTheWanted","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Megadeth","id":"7709052329","info":{"id":"7709052329","about":"New Album \"Super Collider\" In Stores June 4.\nPre-Order Now at Amazon: http://bit.ly/YDe8My.\nwww.twitter.com/megadeth www.instagram.com/megadeth","app_id":"0","band_members":"Dave Mustaine\nChris Broderick\nDavid Ellefson\nShawn Drover","bio":"Megadeth is an American heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1983 with its roots in thrash metal, a genre that its founder, singer/songwriter and guitarist Dave Mustaine helped pioneer. The band has since released 13 studio albums.  Megadeth consists of Dave Mustaine (vocals, guitars), Chris Broderick (guitars, background vocals), David Ellefson (bass, background vocals) and Shawn Drover (drums, percussion, background vocals).\n\nMustaine's musical roots began early on listening to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin, and took form in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal when he co-founded Metallica. Megadeth emerged in 1985 at the forefront of the thrash/speed metal scene with their seminal debut \"Killing Is My Business… And Business Is Good\", and continued on a blistering path of albums and tours throughout the decade. The nickname \"world's state-of-the-art speed metal band\" and the critic-coined \"intellectual thrash metal\" were often used to describe Megadeth's sound, referring to Mustaine's niche for angry, witty, intelligent lyrics about topics like politics, drugs and war, fused with aggressive, intricate guitar structures and a jazz-influenced rhythm section.\n\nWith a string of five consecutive platinum and multi-platinum albums Megadeth became one of the biggest bands of the mid-‘80s and ‘90s, boasting such arena anthems as “Peace Sells… But Who’s Buying\" (The opening bassline was used as the theme for MTV News for years afterward), \"Holy Wars… The Punishment Due\", \"Symphony Of Destruction\" and \"Sweating Bullets\", along with the top singles in 1997/98 off \"Cryptic Writings\", \"Trust\"  (No. 1 radio track), \"Almost Honest\", \"Use The Man\" and \"A Secret Place\". In all, the band has scored five Top 10 albums and two Top 5 releases.\n\nThe 90's saw a change in Megadeth's sound with the polished and commercial multi-platinum release \"Countdown To Extinction\", which skyrocketed them into multi-platinum success and MTV stardom. The incorporation of this new sound would be a trademark of every release to come, and would eventually earn them 11 Grammy nominations for Best Metal Performance, 7 platinum certifications, and selling more than 38 million albums worldwide. \n\nAfter a brief hiatus early in the 2000's, Mustaine triumphantly returned with a comeback album, a heavy metal festival called Gigantour and a new display of prodigious musicians to back him. The band's legacy continued with 2009's critically acclaimed \"Endgame\", which debuted at #9 on the Billboard charts and 2010's multi-platinum \"The Big Four: Live From Sofia\", Bulgaria featuring the \"Big Four\" of 1980's thrash metal — Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax.\n\nMegadeth's 13th studio album, \"TH1RT3EN\" was released in November, 2011 debuting at #1 on The Billboard Hard Rock Albums chart and #11 on the Billboard 200. The album was recorded at Vic's Garage studio in San Marcos, California with producer Johnny K. The band is currently working on their 14th studio album titled \"Super Collider\", which is due for release in June, 2013. \"Super Collider\" is the first release on Mustaine’s new label, Tradecraft, through Universal Music Enterprises.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151307679027330","source":"http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/149068_10151307679027330_253566247_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Los Angeles","genre":"Thrash Metal","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":6193105,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Megadeth","name":"Megadeth","talking_about_count":156927,"username":"Megadeth","website":"www.megadeth.com, http://cyberarmy.megadeth.com, www.twitter.com/megadeth, www.myspace.com/megadeth, www.twitter.com/davemustaine, www.facebook.com/davemustaine, http://www.smarturl.it/megadethstore, www.instagram.com/davemustaine, www.instagram.com/megadeth","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Lana Del Rey","id":"117713628271096","info":{"id":"117713628271096","about":"BORN TO DIE - THE PARADISE EDITION - OUT NOW.

And there are fewer still who embody the drive and determination of the great old bachata performers, when the genre was consigned to the smaller rural areas of the Dominican Republic.\n \nBut “it is much overdue” as Prince Royce explains, we need a new talent whose name symbolizes both performing excellence and Latin pride. Singing in both English and Spanish, it is easy to see this gifted young man quickly becoming one of the genre’s hottest new stars.   \n\nGeoffrey Royce Rojas was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, and this city has remained a key influence in developing his unique musical style which not only sets him apart from the rest, but has also added to the growth of his career. \n\nHis inclination towards bachata is not just a coincidence. His parents who are both from the land of the bachata, the Dominican Republic, always instilled in him a strong sense of cultural identity and pride.    \n\n“I feel one hundred percent Dominican,” he reveals with a smile, although his strong Caribbean accent has already given him away. \n\nThough he may be a novice to the music industry, he is no stranger to performing. Captivated by the popular music and dance moves of his childhood, he auditioned and performed in numerous school talent shows from very early on. “I needed to know what it felt like to be any given character in front of a lot of people,” he explains, alluding to his first stage performances in elementary school shows. \n\nIn addition to his spontaneity and determination to be an artist, Royce had two important factors in his favor. The first was the unconditional support of his family. \n\n“My mother also dreamed of becoming an artist in her youth, so she was always my biggest supporter when I’d say that I wanted to be an artist. But generally, my entire family has always stood behind me,” he reflects.\n   \nThe second factor in his favor was being raised in New York City. “I noticed that everything around me was defined by the latest trends and styles, so I started defining my own brand of music, nourished by all the experiences that a city like New York can offer, a place where only those that innovate can truly have an impact and make a difference.\n\nAt 13 he discovered a new “hobby” that occupied all of his time and fueled his inspiration, bringing him closer to his ultimate goal. “I began writing poetry and eventually songs, inspired by the personal experiences and issues that affected my generation,” he recalls. \n\nAt the age of 15, he begins to narrow in on what he wants to do as a performer and begins “experimenting” with music, working towards becoming a great new artist.  \n\nSome time later, Prince Royce would unknowingly discover his artistic destiny, after meeting his future manager Andrés Hidalgo, who suggested that he sing a few bachata songs to judge the quality of his voice. \n\n“It wasn’t a total surprise because I knew that sooner or later I would be performing traditional Dominican music professionally, it just had not occurred to me as my first choice, but I am thrilled that it happened this way.”\n\nStill, he promises that what will set him apart will “not be purely bachata,” but rather more of an urban experience within the tropical genre. “I want to take the bachata to the next level, to break away from the traditional sound that is familiar to everyone”, he emphasizes. \n\nWith a fun-loving, energetic personality typical of a Latin youth, topped with ambition and a fervent determination to achieve his objectives, Royce firmly believes in his music and says that he will not let his fans down by offering more of the same thing. \n\nHis debut album, titled “Prince Royce”, features mostly bachatas fused with other contemporary rhythms like pop and rhythm and blues, all written by Royce himself. \n\t\n“I want people to see me as a complete artist that can sing and do whatever it takes to entertain. That is why I say that I am open to all musical genres”, he reveals while adding that this album also includes some softer melodious tunes as well as up tempo ones. \n\nSo how did you come up with the title? “I discovered that my name ‘Royce’ means ‘The King’s son’, or someone of royal birth, so naturally I felt that Prince Royce would be in tone with that and be catchy at the same time”. \n\nHe was joined in the recording studio by a select team of industry experts that sealed the production with the outmost care and professionalism. “This was an incredible experience for me and I felt very excited to see the entire project come together to perfection with each recording”, says Royce with a look of evident satisfaction. \n\nThe album’s first single is “Corazón sin Cara”, a romantic ballad “that relates how true love isn’t about physical beauty; it’s about feelings that come straight from the heart”. \n\nHe is part of the music catalogue for the Top Stop Music Label, headed by distinguished music producer Sergio George, who has worked with renowned music superstars like Marc Anthony, Jennifer López, Celia Cruz, India and Christina Aguilera, to name a few.\n\n“I feel very honored to be able to have the support of this important company in my career, the feeling of reliability and trust that comes from knowing you have the best team on your side when you are fighting for your dreams is priceless,” he confesses. \n\n“I want to continue doing the things that move me, and to become what I want to be: an artist that is able to touch people’s hearts through my lyrics, so that before I leave this world I am able to make a positive difference in other’s lives”.\n\nUndoubtedly, his creative fusion of styles, melodious voice and charisma, added to steady tenacity make it obvious from the very first note that in no time at all this talented young man will be taking over the tropical music market by storm, earning the international recognition he deserves.\n\nSeptember, 2009","booking_agent":"William Morris Endeavor // Michel Vega","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151282112169003","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/184656_10151282112169003_840616558_n.png","offset_y":21,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Miami, Florida","genre":"Bachata/ Pop/R&B","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Bronx, New York","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":6720948,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/princeroyce","name":"Prince Royce","press_contact":"Jennifer Nieman // The Nieman Group // jennifer@niemangroup.com","record_label":"Sony Music Latin","talking_about_count":155876,"username":"princeroyce","website":"www.PrinceRoyce.com ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Reik","id":"98300606355","info":{"id":"98300606355","about":"Página Oficial","app_id":"0","band_members":"Jesus Alberto Navarro Rosas\nGilberto \"Bibi\" Marín\nJulio Ramirez Eguía","bio":"Más información visita www.reik.tv o www.westwoodent.com","booking_agent":"AC Shows Tel. 53372020 Ext. 114, 120 y 290.

Somos #Dos3 (Pai, Filho e Espírito Santo). ","app_id":"0","band_interests":"JESUS CRISTO!","bio":"Na adolescência, Thalles montou uma banda e tocava não só em sua igreja, mas em outras denominações também. Assim, conheceu os grandes nomes ‘musicais' de Belo Horizonte, como Nívea Soares, André, Ana Paula e Mariana Valadão, dentre outros.\n\nDono de um talento incomum, e muito conhecido na capital mineira, Thalles foi procurado por profissionais da música secular, que viam nele um diferencial para alguns trabalhos. Querendo ‘aprimorar' seus conhecimentos, ele partiu para o mercado e passou a integrar o time do Jota Quest, banda pop secular, por cinco anos. O ‘aprimoramento', porém, teve lá seu preço: Thalles se desligou da Igreja, abandonou seu trabalho como ministro de louvor e se desviou totalmente do Caminho.\n\nSete anos depois de sua decisão pelo secular, Thalles resolveu que era hora de voltar para a casa do Pai. De braços abertos, ele foi recebido na Igreja Batista da Lagoinha, pelo pastor Márcio Valadão, que lhe deu uma palavra muito particular. Apesar de decidido a sair da banda onde estava, Thalles ainda não havia tomado uma iniciativa. \"Continuei cantando por um período, até que o Senhor me deu um ‘ultimato'. Após um show em Brasília, avisei ao produtor que não ficaria mais. Ninguém entendeu minha atitude, mas, com certeza, fiz a melhor opção da minha vida\", relata.\n\nTempos depois, Thalles voltou a compor e gravou, em Belo Horizonte, seu primeiro CD e DVD. \"Deus permitiu que esse trabalho fosse feito num dos melhores estúdios de Belo Horizonte, que um dia eu mesmo toquei, mas para o secular. Trabalho pronto, o meu produtor, Alex Passos, que também fez o DVD do André (Valadão), apresentou o projeto à direção da Graça Music. Começaram as conversas e, hoje, faço parte dessa família\", diz, sorrindo.\n\nA Graça Music passou, então, a distribuir o CD e o DVD Na Sala do Pai, que logo atingiram marcas impressionantes. O CD já ultrapassou a marca de 100mil cópias vendidas, rendendo ao cantor discos de Ouro e de Platina. O DVD bateu a casa das 25 mil cópias, sendo mais um Disco de Ouro. O CD Raízes, uma coletânea de clássicos do gospel, ultrapassou a marca de 40mil cópias vendidas, dando ao cantor mais um Disco de Ouro.\n\nRecentemente, no Chevrolet Hall, em Belo Horizonte, Thalles gravou, pela Graça Music, mais um projeto, sendo o primeiro ao vivo: CD e DVD Uma história escrita pelo dedo de Deus. Mais de 5600 pessoas compareceram ao evento, que contou com uma superprodução de som, áudio, luz e estrutura.\n\n\"Esse é o trabalho dos sonhos\", disse Thalles. Um sonho que se transformou em realidade com vários toques de ousadia, como um dirigível, que sobrevoava o público, gravando imagens exclusivas. 'Culpa' do diretor de vídeo, Alex Passos.\n\nAo todo, 22 canções foram gravadas, entre inéditas e regravações, além de duas participações especiais: a de André Valadão, na canção \"Deus me ama\", e de Gabriela Rocha, na faixa \"Nada além de Ti\".","booking_agent":"Doninha - Importante: E-mails enviados serão lidos e respondidos em até 72 horas.

So far he has released three mixtapes, 2006’s Room for Improvement, 2007’s Comeback Season, and 2009’s critically acclaimed So Far Gone, which is considered one of the best mixtapes of 2009. He is in the beginning stages of recording his major label debut, tentatively titled Thank Me Later, which is projected to be released late 2009. The first single from the album, Best I Ever Had, debuted at #92 and has since reached #2 on the Billboard Top 100. Should it reach the #1 position, Drake would be only the second artist to have a #1 single without having a recording contract at the time of its release. The music video for the song is directed by fellow rapper Kanye West. In June 2009, it was revealed that an unauthorized album entitled The Girls Love Drake, that featured songs from his mixtapes and credited to be an official Drake release, was up for sale on iTunes. A lawsuit is planned against the Canadian label who uploaded the album and claimed they represented Drake. Drake has previously dated singer Keshia Chanté, and is rumoured to be seeing R&B sensation Rihanna though neither have confirmed or denied the relationship.\n\nDrake has been writing songs since he was ten years old. Since then he’s collaborated with The Clipse, Pharrell and Justin Timberlake, has 30 registered fan clubs, more than 80,000 topics on message boards, and a collective attendance of over 20000 fans for mall tours. He has done interviews and specials for MTV, The New York Times, TeenNick, Teen People, Elle Girl, Pop Star Magazine, and 17. In 2006, Drake has launched and promoted his first mixtape. It provides insight into the mind of a changing man. From the smooth ballads that can be cherished by the softest women, to tales of his family during “the Memphis days” – songs best understood by a genuine hustler. In his words: “I didn’t make this album to be judged, or for listeners to tell me what I need to alter about my image for the next project. I simply made it because it felt right. All the songs on here were made on certain dates due to certain events in my life and nothing was rushed. I’m telling you right off the bat who I am. I used to lie to people to impress them but those times had to cease. It’s like trying to get back together after a break up. You’ve had your time apart, and right away you want to express all your concerns, all your flaws, and let them know exactly what you’ve been through so that there’s little room for error. I really just want to draw the fans into me as a person so that we can communicate better in the future. I need you to understand my concept before you listen. If you’re not willing to do me that favor, we may as well remain split up.” Drake continues to pursue his passion for R&B, penning lyrics for many up and coming R&B singers. Much of his musical influence comes from his family, which includes funk creator Larry Graham (Graham Central Station) who’s hit song “One In A Million” became a top 10 hit, and Mabon ‘Teenie’ Hodges who, alongside Willie Mitchell, was the soulful mastermind behind the majority of Al Green’s hits (9 Grammy Awards). Drake has worked with Cash Money Records, TVT Records, BMG, and has featured on tracks for producers Mike City, Neek Rusher, Saukrates, and Brian Cox. He’s been a guest on Soul Food, and has appeared in movies with Mekhi Phifer and Omar Epps, and received two Young Artist Awards, the Shaw Rocket Award, and a Teen Choice Awards.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"genre":"Rap","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Toronto","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":28931648,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Drake","name":"Drake","talking_about_count":143802,"username":"Drake","website":"www.octobersveryown.net http://www.drakeofficial.com/ www.twitter.com/drake http://twitter.com/welcomeovo http://uverseonline.att.net/drake www.myspace.com/thisisdrake www.youtube.com/drakevevo","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"will.i.am","id":"5120148605","info":{"id":"5120148605","about":"#willpower album out now: http://smarturl.it/iamwillpower","app_id":"0","bio":"A seven-time Grammy Award-winner, will.i.am is known not only for his work with The Black Eyed Peas, who have sold 31 million albums and 58 million singles worldwide, but also for his work with some of the entertainment industry’s biggest names, including Michael Jackson, Rihanna, Usher, Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears, David Guetta, and film composer Hans Zimmer. \n\nExecutive Producer/Creator, “i.am FIRST: Science is Rock and Roll”, a back-to-school primetime TV special that aired on ABC August 14, 2011 designed to get students excited about learning STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) skills in, and beyond the classroom.\n\nSelected by “Advertising Age” as a top digital creative executive in the magazine's annual Digital Innovators Issue (February 28, 2011).

They’re us, we’re them, we’re all for one and stronger than all.”\n\n     Of course, it took the Dallas-based Pantera time to find their groove, shape their sound, and harness the right mix of combustible personalities.  The band emerged in the early Eighties, when drummer Vinnie Paul and his guitarist brother Dimebag Darrell put Pantera together with bassist Rex Brown and vocalist T Lee.  After three self-released albums, it was clear that a remarkably different heavier sound was evolving.  Enter new frontman and New Orleans native Philip Anselmo, , on a fourth independant release.  The collaboration with the heavy trio and explosive singer was about to set the stage for a harder, more damaging, trademark Pantera.     \n\nAfter being turned down “twenty-eight times by every major label on the face of the earth,” an Atco Records A&R rep named Mark Ross saw the band when Hurricane Hugo stranded him in Texas.  The long-sought record deal finally arrived, and with it, Pantera’s “official” 1990 debut, titled Cowboys From Hell.  Co-produced by the band and Terry Date (Max Norman turned the project down in favor of Lynch Mob), Cowboys From Hell took Pantera’s evolution to the next level.  Darrell’s chugging, jagged guitars, Vinnie’s machine-gun, darting drums, and Philip’s collection of harsh screams, clenched-fist roars, and eerie melodies, all fused together into a sound they called “power groove.”\n\n     “Cowboys is where everybody came into their own, along with the full-blown Pantera sound,” says Vinnie.  “That was actually the first song we wrote for the record.  Basically it was about us coming out of Texas and being out of place.  People don’t think of Texas as being a hot spot for heavy metal, they think of New York or L.A. or something like that, so it just seemed like an obvious concept for us.”\n\n     Cowboys From Hell spawned several other unquestionable classics, including the moody, morbid epic, “Cemetery Gates.”  “We’ve always done a bunch of musically diverse things,” says Dime.  “I’m a big fan of King’s X and bands like that.  I was just showing a broader side of the band, the more melodic stuff we can do.”\n\n     Months of solid touring molded the band into an even more lethal live act than they had been before, and two years after the release of Cowboys, the band reconvened to lay down what many fans consider their masterpiece: Vulgar Display Of Power.  Working with Date again, the band carved out an even more incendiary sonic assault on an album that truly lived up to its monicker with frightening intensity.  \n\n     The disc yielded, among others, the awesomely heavy shuffle, “Walk,” the pummeling, warped riffage of “Mouth For War,” and the disturbing, bitter “This Love.”  Vinnie:  “If there’s one thing that Philip did the very best, it’s that he always wrote straight from the heart.  He never candy-coated anything or had a bullshit way of saying anything in his lyrics.  ‘This Love’ was pretty much the story of a relationship that he had been in, that just didn’t work out, and he was fuckin’ pissed about it!”\n\n     More endless roadwork followed the release of Vulgar Display, elevating the band into bigger venues and drawing larger audiences all the time.  By the time 1994 and Far Beyond Driven rolled around, Pantera was established as the metal act to beat in terms of heaviness, sheer power, and slavish allegiance to the metal lifestyle.  \n\n     “We drove ourselves, that’s for sure,” says Vinnie about the album, which remains the most extreme disc to ever debut at Number One on the Billboard Top 200. “We didn’t debut at Number One for any other reason than all the fans we had made on tour.  We still weren’t a radio band or anything like that, so it was strictly word-of-mouth and the live show that did it.”\n\n     “We couldn’t get airplay and nobody gave a fuck about it, but the fans damn sure did,” agrees Dime.  “We wrote that record for them.”\n\n     The first single from the album, “I’m Broken,” was “a soundcheck riff – one of them ones where I’d walk in with a hangover from ripping it up night after night with everyone in every town,” chuckles Dime.  “That’s where a lot of the best riffs I ever wrote came from. I just played the first riff I thought of, Vinnie started kickin’ in on it, Rex joined in, we didn’t write the entire song on the spot, but we kept toying with it and finally worked on it once we got into the studio.”\n\n     And then there’s “Five Minutes Alone,” which crystallized the band’s “take no shit” attitude, as Vinnie explains:  “There was a guy in the front row at Pine Knob in Detroit who was heckling Phil.  Finally, several people in the crowd just jumped this guy’s ass and beat the shit out of him on the spot, so he sued us.  And when his dad called our manager, his exact quote was, ‘you just give me five minutes along with that Phil Anselmo guy and I’ll show him who’s big daddy around here.’  Phil’s response was, ‘You just give me five minutes along with that cat’s dad and I’ll whoop his ass.’  That’s where that song came from.”\n\n     As brutal as Far Beyond Driven was, it ended on an uncharacteristically quiet note with the band’s cover of Black Sabbath’s dreamlike “Planet Caravan.”  “Black Sabbath’s one of our all-time favorite groups,” says Vinnie.  “We got asked to be a part of the first Sabbath tribute record, Nativity In Black, and we were thinkin’ about what song to do, and we just suddenly decided that “Planet Caravan” was a cool song, plus nobody would even expect it. It turned out great, but due to legal circumstances, we ended up not being on Nativity In Black, so we added it to the end of Far Beyond Driven.  We thought it was the perfect way to end the record.”\n\n     The Great Southern Trendkill, released in 1996, is now considered Pantera’s “overlooked” album, coming out as rap-metal was hitting its stride and temporarily drowning out the mighty Pantera roar.  Trendkill did, in fact, find Pantera adding some different spices to their corrosive metallic stew, but the chilling “Drag The Waters” best represents the album.  “That song is about a lifetime of dealing with people that you can’t tell what they’re really comin’ at you for, or what their motives really are,” snarls Dime.  “You’ve got to drag the waters to get to the bottom and find out the truth.”\n\n     It was four years before Pantera released their next full-length studio effort, but the band was far from inactive.  Touring nonstop, the boys still managed to find time to release a live album, Official Live: 101 Proof, featuring the ominous studio bonus track, “Where We Come From,” and a scalding cover of Ted Nugent’s “Cat Scratch Fever” for the soundtrack of the Kiss-themed movie, Detroit Rock City.  “Gene Simmons actually approached us to be a part of that,” remembers Vinnie.  “And we were like, ‘we’re old Ted fans, let’s see if we can do a throwdown version of it.’  To this day, I probably still hear our version in titty bars more than I hear his.”\n\n     Dimebag Darrell calls the band’s most recent studio album, 2000’s Reinventing The Steel, a “best-of in its own right,” a mix of elements from the albums that had preceded it.  Even the closing epic, “I’ll Cast A Shadow,” was a monster.  “Usually when we write, the songs come together really fast,” says Dime.  “But sometimes, you’ll be drilling at one for hours before you realize it ain’t workin’.  This was one of those.  So we put it on the back burner, finished up all the other tunes, then went back to give it one more pull.  We rearranged it, throw a few new parts in, and it really brought it to life. I think it ended up being the baddest-ass song on the whole record.”\n\n     “Goddamn Electric,” a tribute to metal itself, was another bad-ass anthem, and warranted a special guest appearance.  “We thought, ‘this song just gives so much respect to these other bands like Black Sabbath and Slayer, we’ve just gotta get Kerry King down here to put a lead on the motherfucker,’” relates Vinnie. “We went and met him at the Starplex in Dallas when Slayer was on Ozzfest.  I took some portable recording gear, and we recorded that lead – first take, one take only, backstage in the bathroom at the Starplex.  And it’s awesome.”\n\n     As one of metal’s most ferocious acts, with one of its most insanely devoted audiences, it’s clear as an empty whiskey bottle that Pantera’s impact and influence on heavy music is still being felt.  “Every time I hear a kick drum with that extra slap on top, or that chainsaw sound on the guitar, I know where it came from,” concludes Dime. “We’re just glad we can hand it down and see everyone else bring some new shit to the table and keep passing it on.  I’m glad we could actually put a stamp out there that everybody could get a pull off of.”","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151353265464697","source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/252079_10151353265464697_412608749_n.jpg","offset_y":87,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Dallas, TX","general_manager":"Kimberly Zide Davis","genre":"Metal","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Dallas, TX","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":6957098,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Pantera","name":"Pantera","record_label":"Elektra/Rhino","talking_about_count":139479,"username":"Pantera","website":"http://www.pantera.com http://www.panterastore.com http://www.myspace.com/pantera http://twitter.com/pantera http://www.reverbnation.com/pantera ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Iron Maiden","id":"172685102050","info":{"id":"172685102050","about":"Scream for me Facebook!","app_id":"0","band_members":"Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers, Steve Harris, Nicko McBrain, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith","bio":"Since their explosion on the scene in the early eighties IRON MAIDEN have been hailed as one of the UK's greatest live acts of all time with their fiery brand of music, spectacle and live performance all of which has excited their fans around the planet for over three decades.

However everything came to a screeching halt in January when Derulo suffered a severe neck injury and was nearly paralyzed while rehearsing for a headlining world tour in support of Future History. Fortunately Derulo made a full recovery and returned in May with an appearance on the season finale of American Idol, during which he performed a new song, “Undefeated,” which featured lyrics submitted by fans through the Coca-Cola Perfect Harmony contest. Derulo has streamed more than half a billion views on his YouTube Channel and sold more than 16 million singles worldwide. He was a five-time winner at the 2011 BMI Pop Awards including being honored as \"Songwriter of the Year\" (which he shared with Lady Gaga and his debut album’s producer JR Rotem), and took home a 2010 Teen Choice Award for “Choice Music: Album, R&B.” Derulo has also been nominated for a four additional Teen Choice Awards, a 2011 NAACP Image Award, an American Music Award, an ARIA and MOBO Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and a Much Music Award. He is currently in the studio working on his third album for Beluga Heights/Warner Bros. Records.\nThe 21-year-old chart-topper is set to release his eagerly awaited sophomore effort, Future History, on Beluga Heights/Warner Bros. Records on September 27th. “It’s where I see myself going in the future,” says Derulo of the meaning behind the album title. “These are the songs I’m going to be singing for the rest of my life, and I’d like my music to live on after I’m no longer around.” \n\nFuture History finds Derulo moving seamlessly from ultra-sexy urban dance tracks to poppy love songs, once again offering up a unique genre-blurring blend of varied sounds deeply rooted in pop. This time, production is handled by The Fliptones, including the first single and instant summer anthem “Don’t Wanna Go Home,” as well as hitmakers J.R. Rotem, Frank E, The Dream, and Eman.\n\n“On this album I just wanted to be me,” explains Derulo, who wrote all of the songs on Future History either by himself or in collaboration with top names like Kara Dioguardi, The Dream, and Claude Kelly. The new batch of songs reflects a newfound maturity in Derulo’s personality as well as the music that he’s eager to share with his fans. “I was 19 before and now I’m 21 and I’ve really kind of found myself,” he says. “So you can hear a whole new person, a new being almost.”  \n\nWhile recording in Serenity Studio in Los Angeles, Derulo created the ideal vibe to inspire the creative process. “Music becomes conversational and real,” says Derulo of his ritual of keeping the studio dimly lit with candles so he can put himself in the place he’s singing about in each song, and express exactly what he’s feeling. “I’m not diluting what I’m saying with a pen, and I’m not editing myself. I’m saying what I feel.”   \n\nHe’s certainly not shying away from his romantic side on Future History, with songs like “It Girl”—on which he sings of his ideal woman being his “greatest hit”—and “Breathing,” a gorgeous love song that also pays tribute to his late cousin with such lyrics as, “I only miss you when I’m breathing.” \n\n“The lyrics are heartfelt, but they’re hidden behind a beat that makes them seem very light,” says Derulo of exposing his softer side on the song, which also features him breaking into an impromptu African chant. “That’s what I think is so cool about it. The song has both a positive and negative vibe. You have both elements.” \n\nAnd you won’t find Derulo holding back when it comes to the details of sexual relationships on tracks like “Make It Up As We Go,” an ode to friends with benefits, and the testosterone-fueled “My Shit,” which he says is the result of his “no boundaries” approach to expressing himself. “It’s pretty graphic,” admits Derulo with a laugh. “It’s a super-manly sexual side, rather than a gentle sexual side. I think there should be a balance. It’s about an amazing time in the bedroom and just giving ownership to what’s mine.” \n\nDerulo has been honing his songcraft for as long as he can remember. Raised on a healthy diet of Prince, Michael Jackson, Elvis, and Madonna while growing up in Miami, Derulo composed his first song, a little ditty called \"Crush On You,\" on the piano at just eight years old. By the time he was a teen, he was attending the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York, where he also competed for and won The Apollo's Grand Championship in 2006.\n\nAt the age of 17, Derulo composed and sang the chorus to \"Bossy” for Southern rapper Birdman, and soon became a sought-after tunesmith, crafting songs for hip-hop star Lil Wayne, R&B singer Cassie, and girl group Danity Kane, to name a few. Around this time, producer J.R. Rotem’s brother Tommy was searching for artists to sign to Rotem’s new label, Beluga Heights, and contacted Derulo through his MySpace page and invited him out to Los Angeles to pen songs for Sean Kingston’s second album. \n\n\"Jason is one of those guys who can write songs for other people but has a career of his own,\" says Rotem, who produced “Pick Up The Pieces,” “Be Careful,” and “Dumb” on Future History. Rotem quickly realized that Derulo belonged in the spotlight himself. \"Jason can write pop songs for women to sing, R&B for men to sing, he can write ballads; he's very eclectic,” Rotem says. “He has really inspired us.\" \n\nProduced by Rotem, Derulo’s debut album brought him a string of smash hit singles last year—the 3x-platinum \"Whatcha Say\" and the 2x-platinum \"In My Head\" and \"Ridin' Solo\"—making Derulo the first male solo artist to score consecutive No. 1's on Billboard's Pop Songs radio airplay chart in its 17-year-history with his first two entries.\nAlso that year, Derulo tried his hand at acting, appearing in the MTV feature film Turn the Beat Around in between tours with two of the biggest acts in the world—first on a six-week stint with Lady Gaga on her sold-out “Monster Ball” tour of North America, and then as support for the Black Eyed Peas in Canada—before headlining his own tour. Since then, Derulo’s live show has continued to grow. “The venues have doubled in size which is pretty cool,” he says. “It’s crazy that it happened in two years.” \n\nDerulo plans to take Future History on his most extensive world tour yet, which will begin in Europe before hitting Australia and America, where he’s sure to put on his most memorable shows to date. “I’m excited to perform this album all over the world,” Derulo says. And fans can expect to see him continue to evolve, as he mounts an even bigger live production, complete with never-seen-before dance moves and plenty of costume changes. \n\n“My goals for myself are almost impossible to reach,” explains Derulo when looking to the future. “It’s just me doing what I’m doing, and that is making music for the world, and hopefully making it a brighter place for somebody.” ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151332437282261","source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/552916_10151332437282261_1562447415_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Miami, FL","description":"Multi-Platinum International Pop Star","general_manager":"Frank Harris -  Frank@23-management.com","genre":" POP","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Miami, FL","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":10115150,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/jasonderulo","name":"Jason Derulo","record_label":"Beluga Heights - Warner Bros Records","talking_about_count":131318,"username":"jasonderulo","website":"http://www.jasonderulo.com ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Slipknot","id":"6478112671","info":{"id":"6478112671","about":"Slipknot App: http://smarturl.it/SlipknotApp\nWorldwide Shows: http://www.slipknot1.com/tour","app_id":"0","band_members":"- Sid #0 - turntables\n- Joey #1 - drums\n- Paul #2 - bass\n- Chris #3 - percussion\n- James #4 - guitar\n- Craig #5 - samples/media\n- Clown #6 - percussion\n- Mick #7 - guitar\n- Corey #8 - vocals\n\n\n\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151384818612672","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/12344_10151384818612672_110618422_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"description":"August events to feature Deftones, Lamb of God, Serj Tankian, the Urge, Cannibal Corpse and more.","genre":"METAL","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Des Moines, Iowa","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":14294965,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/slipknot","name":"Slipknot","record_label":"Roadrunner Records","talking_about_count":128828,"username":"slipknot","website":"www.slipknot1.com | http://wearthemask.slipknot1.com/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Myriam Fares","id":"51542807431","info":{"id":"51542807431","about":"JOIN MYRIAM’S WORLD www.instagram.com/myriamfares  www.twitter.com/myriamfares    www.youtube.com/myriamfares     www.google.com/+MyriamFares      www.facebook.com/myriamfares ","app_id":"0","band_members":"Myriam Fares","booking_agent":"roula@myriammusic.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151528836742432","source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/39279_10151528836742432_1153836584_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Lebanon","general_manager":"Myriam Music","genre":"Pop/Arabic","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Lebanon","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":3889695,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/myriamfaresfans","name":"Myriam Fares","press_contact":"info@myriammusic.com","record_label":"Myriam Music","talking_about_count":127635,"username":"myriamfaresfans","website":"www.myriamfares.com - Twitter: www.twitter.com/myriamfares - youtube: www.youtube.com/myriamfares - Google+ www.google.com/+MyriamFares - Facebook: www.facebook.com/myriamfares - www.instagram.com/myriamfares","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Thirty Seconds to Mars","id":"5618127822","info":{"id":"5618127822","about":"[ OFFICIAL BAND PAGE ] PROVEHITO IN ALTUM • @30SECONDSTOMARS • thirtysecondstomars.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Jared Leto \nShannon Leto\nTomo Milicevic \n","bio":"Thirty Seconds to Mars' latest album title – This Is War – is more than a just a reference to the band’s personal battles, a commentary on global crises and economic turmoil and homage to their now infamous $30,000,000 lawsuit with Virgin Records. This Is War also represents the result of an 18-month creative battle, fought ferociously, but privately, inside a studio built into the side of a house tucked away in the Hollywood Hills. The result: a triumphant, sonically epic game-changer that builds on the vision laid out in their 2002 self-titled debut and 2005’s multi-platinum A Beautiful Lie. This Is War is a major leap forward for Thirty Seconds to Mars, one that cements the trio (lead singer and guitarist Jared Leto, drummer Shannon Leto and guitarist Tomo Milicevic) as a world-class arena-crushing rock band.

Easily identified by its members' trademark face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid and late-1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, and pyrotechnics. Kiss has been awarded 24 gold albums to date.The band has sold over 85 million albums to date.\n\nThe original lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: The Demon (Simmons), Starchild (Stanley), Spaceman (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. The \"Demon\" makeup reflected Gene's cynicism and dark elements, as well as his love for comic books. Paul Stanley became the \"Starchild\" due to his tendency to be referred to as the \"starry-eyed lover\" and \"hopeless romantic.\" Ace Frehley's \"Spaceman\" makeup was a reflection of him wanting to go for a ride in a space ship and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss' \"Catman\" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Peter had nine lives due to his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley were out of the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had also waned considerably by that point.\n\nIn 1983, Kiss abandoned its makeup and enjoyed a commercial resurgence throughout the rest of the decade. Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.\n\nKISS is regarded as one of the most influential rock and roll bands of all-time. Their career milestones are staggering. KISS holds honors as one of America’s top gold record champions, recording 36 albums over 32 years selling over 85 million albums worldwide.\n\nOver thirty years of record-breaking tours around the globe include high-profile appearances at Super Bowl XXXIII, the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and most recently, the 2005 Rockin’ The Corps concert dedicated to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe KISS legacy continues to grow, generation after generation, transcending age, race and creed. The unparalleled devotion and loyalty of the KISS Army to the “Hottest Band in the World” is a striking testament to the band’s unbreakable bond with its fans.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150768253516412","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/536239_10150768253516412_1086567833_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Hard Rock, Heavy Metal","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"New York, NY","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":9025605,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/KISS","name":"KISS","talking_about_count":126897,"username":"KISS","website":"www.kissonline.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Evanescence","id":"7091561785","info":{"id":"7091561785","about":"Download the latest self-titled album on iTunes! http://bit.ly/p1PljK","app_id":"0","bio":"Evanescence’s third album is self titled for a reason: 15 years after its formation, the multi-platinum band has made the most collaborative, united album of its career. And it rocks.\n \n“Coming back together is such a beautiful and happy thing,” co-founder and lead singer Amy Lee says of making “Evanescence,” the group’s first album since 2006’s “The Open Door.”  “We’d bring a song to the whole band and arrange it in a group. That’s something that really stands out against the other records. There’s a tight band at the center of everything, giving it a very tangible energy.”\n \nThe cohesion is evident in every note. The album, produced by Nick Raskulinecz (Alice In Chains, Def Tones),  packs a wallop with a unified vision that can only come from a group working together as a creative unit.\n \nLed by Lee’s operatic, passionate vocals, Evanescence has sold close to 25 million albums since its 2003 debut, “Fallen.” The project’s premiere single, “Bring Me To Life,”  snagged the band a Grammy for best hard rock performance. Other massive hits followed, including “My Immortal,” “Going Under,” and “Call Me When You’re Sober,” establishing Evanescence as worldwide tour headliners.\n \nAfter a break following the conclusion of the tremendously successful tour behind “The Open Door,”  the band— Lee, guitarists Terry Balsamo and Troy McLawhorn, bassist Tim McCord and drummer Will Hunt— came together to write a number of songs for “Evanescence” before heading to Nashville, where, under Raskulinecz’s tutelage, they penned another six songs.\n \n“We were just sitting on a little stage in a circle with Nick standing there air-shredding on a drumstick. He’d say, ‘Stop. After the bridge, why don’t you do a breakdown and then go into an instrumental thing.’ He directed us,” Lee recalls. “It was really good for us to have that outside perspective.”\n \nThe group then retreated to Nashville’s Blackbird Studios to record. “Nick got it. He understood what we were going for,” Lee says. “The thing he was going to amp up was the band side, which was what we wanted to focus on.”\n \n“Evanescence” crackles with an urgency that seeps through each of the 12 tracks. Opening slab, the hard-driving “What You Want,” is about Lee’s decision to head back into the fray after the band’s hiatus. “It’s totally about going back to being in Evanescence,” she says. “It’s motivating myself not to be afraid. I’m writing about the chaos of life and that you can’t control all the crazy things that happen to you.”\n \nThe stunning video for the single, helmed by award-winning director Meiert Avis from an idea conceived by Lee and her younger sister, Carrie, traces the history of the band combined with  gothic imagery of New York. It ends with the group’s members walking into the ocean. “I can’t make a video without some water,” Lee laughs. “It’s either going to rain on me or I’m getting into the water. Here, it represents us moving on into this unknown thing; going into the future.”\n \nThe wrenching “Lost In Paradise” opens with Lee’s haunting solo piano before exploding into a sweeping, string-laden tale of torment. “It’s the most intimate song on the album,”  Lee says. “This song came out in a moment where I felt lost, I was at war within myself. It’s raw and open.”\n \n“It was Nick’s idea for the band to come in where they do,” Lee says. “I love how big and important it’s become for all of us. It started out as this tiny, raw thing and it’s become one of my favorite songs.” \n \nHeavy, chugging guitars propel “The Other Side,” a story of love that survives whatever tries to destroy it, including death, while the rhythmic, multi-layered “My Heart Is Broken” takes the listener on a journey of escape. “That was inspired by victims of sex trafficking,” Lee reveals. “It’s about trying to find your way out.”\n \nThe album closes with a last-minute addition:  the dreamy, atmospheric “Swimming Home,” a tune that exposes a side of Evanescence that fans have never seen. “That song is the biggest departure,” Lee says. “It came from a phase when I was making music that was ethereal and programming driven. Thematically, “Swimming” addresses “crossing over into the next life. It’s the bittersweet acceptance.”\n \nThe break between “The Open Door” and “Evanescence” provided the band with much-deserved rest, but also some clarity as to how important what they had created meant to them.\n \n“I do have a new perspective and a big part of that for me was being able to step away and knowing for certain that I’m here making this record because I love what I do,” Lee says.\n \nLee spent her time away from the band with her new husband and learning how to lead a “normal” adult life in her adopted hometown of New York City.  “Evanescence is my life’s work. I’ve been working on it since I was a young teenager,” Lee says. “By the time we finishing touring ‘The Open Door,’ I just wanted to nest a little bit... and build a life that didn’t revolve around my being in Evanescence.”\n \nBut then the muse came calling and Lee and her bandmates felt an urgent need to express what was building inside of them. “The reason our music is epic and dramatic is because the biggest emotions that I ever feel, the music is the only way to get them out of my heart,” Lee says. “Words alone aren’t enough. It heals my heart to make music.”\n \nNow, Evanescence’s thoughts have turned to returning to the road.  “This record is so geared for live shows,” Lee says. “We were thinking about playing live the whole time we were writing it.”\n \nMaking the return all the sweeter are the fans. “I can’t describe how great it feels to have their support. I love so much meeting them before and after the show. If feels like they’re growing with us,” says Lee.\n \nThough already superstars, Lee and her bandmates have the enthusiasm of newcomers as they look to a future that is brimming with possibility through  “Evanescence.”\n \n“This moment right now between us and the fans, it feels like a celebration, a homecoming, a family reunion,” Lee says. “We’re so happy to be back.” ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151368112246786","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/601769_10151368112246786_1168591352_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"New York, NY","genre":"Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"New York, NY","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":19863597,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Evanescence","name":"Evanescence","record_label":"Wind-up Records","talking_about_count":125141,"username":"Evanescence","website":"http://www.evanescence.com http://twitter.com/Evanescence http://www.youtube.com/evanescencevideo","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Skrillex","id":"119702488081975","info":{"id":"119702488081975","about":"Get My First EP FREE: http://www.bloodcompany.net/skrillexep/       ","app_id":"0","band_members":"SSSSKKKRRRIIILLLLLEEEEXXXXX","booking_agent":"Lee Anderson: Lee@amonly.com ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":450087091710178,"source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/560374_450087091710178_639435418_n.jpg","offset_y":36,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Los Angeles","description":"Publicity: \n(US) Kathryn Fraizer - Kathryn@Biz3.net\n(Australia) Carl West - Carl@NeonRecords.com.au\n(UK) Alex Darling - Alex Darling Alex.Darling@atlanticrecords.co.uk\n(Europe) Danielle Geiger - Danielle.Geiger@atlanticrecords.com\n(UK/Europe online) Naomi Williams - naomi@totemlondon.com\n\nBooking\nNorth & South America: Lee Anderson - lee@amonly.com\nEurope: Simon Clarkson - SMC@wmeentertainment.com\nAustralia: lee@amonly.com + SMC@wmeentertainment.com\nAsia: Lee Anderson - lee@amonly.com\nS Africa: Lee Anderson - lee@amonly.com","general_manager":"Tim Smith ","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Los Angeles","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":11510364,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/skrillex","name":"Skrillex","press_contact":"(US) Kathryn Fraizer - Kathryn@Biz3.net","record_label":"Big Beat / Owsla","talking_about_count":123503,"username":"skrillex","website":"http://www.skrillex.com/ http://twitter.com/skrillex http://www.youtube.com/TheOfficialSkrillex ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Johnny Cash","id":"8651510029","info":{"id":"8651510029","about":"www.johnnycashonline.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Johnny Cash","bio":"Beginning his career as an outlaw to the Nashville establishment, Johnny Cash has come to define country music over the last 40 years.

The Georgian who burst on the scene in 2007 with his unique blend of down-home accessibility, movie star good looks and relatable lyrics, is set to explode in a major way.\n\nNot a flash-in-the-pan, overnight sensation, Luke has built his career from the ground up and the Leesburg, Ga., native wouldn’t have it any other way. “My path is exactly where I want it to be,” Luke says. “I’m doing my thing. I’m getting better with every album.”\n\nThe son of a peanut farmer, Luke knows patience and determination are key elements when it comes to a successful crop—or career—and he’s dedicated to growth. His first album, I’ll Stay Me, produced the Top 10 hits “All My Friends Say” and “Country Man,” while his sophomore effort, Doin’ My Thing, found the singer-songwriter scoring three straight No. 1 singles: “Do I,” “Someone Else Calling You Baby” and “Rain Is A Good Thing.”\n\nLuke’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. “Country Girl (Shake It For Me),” the lead single from his much-anticipated third album, ranks as the fast-rising single of his career. \n\nWhen Luke scored his first solo performance slot on the 2011 CMT Music Awards, he made the most of it, receiving a standing ovation for his over-the-top performance of “Country Girl (Shake It For Me),” not only from the fans, but also from his artist peers. “When you get performance slots for award shows, that’s a big deal for me,” Luke says. \n\nHe’s equally excited about headlining the 10th annual CMT on Tour, which has an impressive list of alumni, including Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley and Keith Urban. “It’s almost like you’re getting a stamp of approval to go to the next level,” says Luke. “All those artists that were a part of the CMT Tour have crossed over into a larger level of artists.”\n\nHis tours with superstars Tim McGraw, Rascal Flatts and Jason Aldean, as well as his own annual Farm Tour, which offers a student from a local farming family a college scholarship, showcase a stage mastery built working the college and club circuit.\n\n“I want my music to jump off the stage and out of the speakers,” says Luke. “When we do ‘Rain Is A Good Thing’ paired back to back with ‘Country Girl,’ it just feels like the roof is fixin’ to come off the place.”\n\nCritics affirm Luke’s stated goal. The Peoria Star Journal calls him a “playful and confident performer” while the Oregonian dubs him “a serious contender for McGraw’s throne.”\n\nLuke’s fan-voted wins as Academy of Country Music Top New Male and Top New Artist, as well as his score as USA Weekend Breakthrough Artist of the Year at the CMT Music Awards were a “huge validation,” he says. \n\n“Country Girl (Shake It For Me),” with its infectious chorus and backbeat, represents another step forward for the strapping star. Co-written by Luke and Dallas Davidson—the pair also penned “Rain Is A Good Thing”—“Country Girl (Shake It For Me)” sets the tone for, but doesn’t define, tailgates & tanlines.\n\nLuke’s latest album is no doubt his best yet. The 13-song collection (of which Luke co-wrote eight) balances lighter fare with meatier offerings. “I Don’t Want This Night To End,” written by Luke with fellow Georgians Dallas Davidson, Rhett Akins and Ben Hayslip, is destined to be a clap-along concert favorite and radio smash.\n\n“Drunk On You,” written by hit tunesmiths Rodney Clawson, Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, is an intoxicating tale of young love that Luke calls “young and fun.” \n\nAnother song destined to be a radio favorite is “Too Damn Young,” a coming of age tune about the loss of innocence that country fans will no doubt relate to.\n\n“Harvest Time,” written by Luke with Rodney Clawson, is an autobiographical look at Luke’s rural roots, while “Don’t Know Jack,” penned by Erin Enderlin and Shane McAnally, is a stark reminder of the power of alcohol addiction.\n\n“Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,” is an up-tempo lets-make-love-one-more-time-even-though-we-know-we’re-splitting-up song, while “Been There Done That” is the ultimate kiss-off tune.\n\nIn short, tailgates & tanlines represents real life.\n\n“I’m really proud that I’ve got some meatier things on this album,” Luke says of the balance between hell raisers and heart breakers. “Nothing is more frustrating to me than putting a song on an album and regret putting it on there. I’m excited that there are no songs on tailgates & tanlines that I’m iffy about.”\n\nAs dedicated as he is to his craft, Luke is even more dedicated to his family: wife Caroline and sons Bo and Tate. “I try to make my time in Nashville mean something for the boys,” he says.\n\n“It’s a big fun ride for everybody,” Luke says of his success.  “My wife and I are enjoying life more than ever.”\n\nWhile superstardom is knocking on his door, Luke Bryan will answer when he’s ready. “I have never wanted to grow fast in this business,” he maintains. “I have always wanted to take my time, make it happen and be smart about it and I’ve been lucky—all that stuff is happening.”\n\nLuke’s aw-shucks demeanor belies his rare gifts. This singer/songwriter/entertainer is the complete package and superstardom is inevitable.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151639797661031","source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/600902_10151639797661031_1788690811_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":60},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4363728,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/lukebryan","name":"Luke Bryan","record_label":"Capitol Nashville","talking_about_count":116357,"username":"lukebryan","website":"www.lukebryan.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"AC/DC","id":"6750402929","info":{"id":"6750402929","about":"For those about to rock, we salute you.","app_id":"0","band_members":"Angus Young: Guitar\nMalcolm Young: Guitar\nBrian Johnson: Vocals\nPhil Rudd: Drums\nCliff Williams: Bass","bio":"More than three decades into a career that shows no signs of slowing down or letting up, AC/DC, like electricity itself, provides the world with an essential source of power and energy.

Sony BMG Music Entertainment's  #1 best-selling catalog act worldwide, AC/DC has sold nearly 70 million albums in the U.S. alone, making AC/DC one of the five top-selling bands in American music history.

After well over a decade of sparring in the music business, these four young, dynamic guys with a seldom-seen chemistry continue to auto-produce soulful, original music that gleams with excellence.  Their nouveau sound fuses bachata (a guitar-based Dominican folkloric music sometimes called the “Dominican blues”) with R & B, hip hop and other American pop and urban styles.  Lead singer and songwriter Anthony “Romeo” Santos’ original songs are often deep, dealing with social issues.  Even when they tackle timeless themes, such as romance and heartbreak, Romeo’s approach always comes from a different angle.\n\nBecause the Santos boys are so young, it seems incredible that they struggled for eight years before exploding on the scene in the summer of 2002.  Bachata’s conservative base was not accepting of their signature sound; for years the traditional audience either “booed” them off the stage or refused to acknowledge them.  After all, on a scene dominated by traditionalist stars such as Anthony “El Mayimbe” Santos and rising romantic minstrels, Zacarías Ferreira, Aventura’s music was truly radical.\n\nHowever, in summer of 2002, the song “Obsesion” hit the airwaves and  “Aventura-mania” was born. Loyal fans from the group’s Bronx  neighborhood ran with the innovative sounds of their local band, and the fanaticism soon spread across the tri-state area, into the Northeast and across the country.\n\nIf Aventura fever in the US and Latin America is a phenomena, the band’s impact in Europe has been utterly astounding.  For 16 straight weeks the single “Obsesion” charted number 1 in Italy; the album We Broke The Rules topped the charts for months as well. From there Aventura charted number one in Spain, Holland, Belgium, Austria, Greece, Slovenia, Romania among others.  In France, 20 days after release 400,000 singles had been distributed with 139,000 CDs.  In Germany, “Obsesion” by Aventura held the number one spot with more than 200,000 CDs sold, while a cover version of “Obsesion” by German pop group Third Wish, held the number two position. The song spread through Poland, Russia, Slovakia and Israel, to name a few.  “Obsesion” had penetrated the mainstream European market to the point that the “Smurfs” in Germany and Spain have created a parody of the song for inclusion in a future “Smurfs” record release.\n\nIn April, 2005 Aventura released GOD’S PROJECT, its 4th studio production.  It continues to be one of Sony’s most important sellers having sold in excess of 500,000; it remains number one in sales on the Billboard Tropical Chart and in the top ten in Latin Albums; it continues to chart in Billboard General Heatseekers in the top 15.  This album is a successful experiment in blending world cultures, hip hop, R & B and bachata – it features UN CHI CHI which contains a sample of an Indian pop song performed by the Queen of Bollywood, Asha Bhosle; UN BESO which is flamenco-bachata; Yuly Terrero of Goodfellas Enterprise produced an urban style video for UN BESO as well as for ELLA Y YO a reggaeton-bachata featuring the performances of Don Omar.  Dominican producer great Juan Basanta produced a mini-movie video for the hit single, LA BODA.\n\nOn March 10th, Aventura sold out again – this time at the Madison Square Garden Theater; the concert was recorded and is yet unreleased. On March 25th the group sold out once again at Altos de Chavon, Dominican Republic, one of the most revered ampitheatres in the hemisphere.  Selections from this landmark event have been released on KOB Live and in the DVD package containing the hit Dominican film, Sanky Panky.\n\nAventura’s fifth album KOB Live (Kings of Bachata) was released on 12/19/2006 and has sold 460,000 units as of May, 2008.  The album is an elegant three disc project – two audio discs (containing 5 new studio songs, the best-of international performances and comedic skits by Aventura’s members) and a video component with excerpts from the sold-out concerts at Madison Square Garden and Altos de Chavon (La Romana, Dominican Republic) as well as the studio video “Los infieles” directed by Jessy Terrero and a pot-pourri of B-roll footage to delight fans).   KOB features a number of industry personalities including Don Omar, a Miri Ben-Ari (The Hip Hop Violinist who has performed with artists such as Alicia Keyes, JayZ and many others) and Luis Jimenez from El Vacilon de la Mañana, to name a few.  The lead single, “Los infieles” hit number one across the country, soon to enjoy similar success in Europe where it debuts on 12/19 as well. The second single, “Mi corazoncito” had a more significant impact; it won multi awards at Premio lo Nuestro, Billboard Latin Awards, Premio La Juventud, Monitor Latino and received an ASCAP Award for Song of the year.  \n\nOn September 1, 2007 Aventura performed at the Madison Square Garden Arena. The show featured a number of guests artists including El Torito, Don Omar, Miri Ben-Ari, Olga Tañon, Wisin & Yandel and Anthony Santos “El Mayimbe.”  The DVD, released on 11/13/07, has sold close to 400,000 units, unprecedented for a tropical DVD containing no new material.\n\nIn September, 2008 Aventura performed once again at the Madison Square Garden Arena together with mega-stars Marc Anthony and Alejandro Fernandez and capped off their fall program on a multi-city tour with Enrique Iglesias.  The tickets recently went on sale for Aventura’s long-awaited Puerto Rican December 5th concert at El Coliseo, a 16,000 capacity venue.  Within hours the date was sold out.   Aventura beat the previous record held by the Rolling Stones – they sold 8,000.  Eventually, the single concert became 5 dates at the Coliseo, all sold out.\n\nOn June 9th, 2009, under the auspices of Premium Latin Music/Sony BMG, The Last, Aventura’s 5th studio album, debuted at #5 on Billboard 200 and #1 across the board on Latin Charts, selling more than 47,000 units according to Nielsen Soundscan.  The group participated in 10 In Stores across the country – New York, Miami, Canovanas & San Juan, Puerto Rico, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Bronx, NY, Boston and Washington.  With 3,000 plus fans in attendance at each in store, the tour was a success of historic proportions – a phenomena.   The Last has dominated the number 1 spot on Billboard during 17 weeks since release. To name just a few landmark accomplishments associated with The Last, on 12/04 the group was presented with the key to the city in Houston and the fourth of December was made the official “Aventura day” by Mayor Bill White.  Aventura headed a toy drive on 12/22/09 in New York City in association with the not-for-profit organization Hands On New York where 700 toys were collected and donated.  The Last Tour sold at across the country in stadium venues – it has had major Billboard write-ups and is listed as one of the most successful live tours of 2009.  Aventura boasts 7 nominations for Premium Lo Nuestro, which award ceremony is slated for February 18, 2010.  Perhaps the height of Aventura’s career, among so many extraordinary accomplishments, was their performance at the White House for Fiesta Latina in October, 2009.   The group members personally met with President Obama.\n\nThe above is characteristic of Aventura’s trajectory where the group has been a consistent award winner.  However, 2008 was unprecedented because Aventura had not released a studio album since God’s Project in 2005.   At Premium lo Nuestro 2008 the group took four awards: Album of the Year (KOB Live), Duo or Group, Song of the Year (“Mi corazoncito”), Tropical Artist.  “Mi corazoncito” took Song of the Year and Tropical Airplay at the Billboard Awards.  The band has been nominated in four categories for Premio la Juventud 2008: Voice of the Moment, Favorite Concert (KOB Live), Best Tropical Artist, Favorite Ringtone (“Un beso”).\n\nThe members of Aventura are Romeo (lead singer and featured composer), Lenny Santos (musical producer and guitarist), Max “Mikey” Santos (bassist and rap artist) and Henry Santos Jeter (singer and composer).\n\nRomeo, lead singer and featured composer, was born on July 21st, 1981 in the Bronx, New York to a Puerto Rican mother and a Dominican father.  At twelve years of age Romeo became a member of the church choir.  Around the same time, he commenced his love affair with Bachata, long before the style became so explosively popular.  A natural songwriter, Anthony’s early compositions were steeped in the tradition of legendary artists such as Blas Duran.  Undoubtedly Romeo’s sweet, soulful voice has played a key role in the group’s success.  However, Romeo’s songwriting is exemplary – progressive, poetic and down-to-earth; he is a Bronx version of Juan Luis Guerra.  Spinning tales of the tough reality of growing up in the concrete jungle, Anthony’s tunes captivate audiences from all walks of life, young and old.  In 2006, Anthony took an ASCAP award in tropical music for his megahit song “OBSESION” and another yet in the American market in Pop – the first time a Hispanic writer has won an ASCAP award in the American market.  In 2007, Romeo took the Billboard Composer of the Year Award over such legendary writers as Marco Antonio Solis and Joan Sebastian.  In 2008 he was nominated once again in this prestigious category.  Frankie J’s cover version of “Obsesion” was #1 across the country in all markets for 22 weeks; this recording earned Romeo ASCAP awards in Latin and Pop.  He has also penned hits for artists such as Wisin & Yandel (“Noche de sexo”), Thalia (“No no no”), El Torito (“Me voy”) and Anthony “El Mayimbe” Santos (“Matame”).\n\nLenny Santos is the group’s guitarist and musical producer/arranger.  Born in the Bronx, New York on October 24th, 1979 Lenny fell in love with music at age 15.  Like most kids his age, his music of choice was hip hop.  However, with Dominican parents, Bachata was a permanent household staple - the soulful twang of the “requinto” always in the background, day and night.  It was only logical that Lenny would experiment by blending his two favorite musical styles – bachata and hip hop.  It is Lenny who created unique the Aventura sound; his excellence and creativity as producer are evident from the first bar of any tune on Aventura’s albums.  Lenny’s approach to bachata has been imitated by young, aspiring guitarists, as well as professionals who have added elements of his signature style to their own productions.  Lenny is an active musical producer in his own right, having signed and produced his own group “Huellas de tiempo;” he is also the musical producer for Sony artist “Optima” among others.\n\nMax “Mikey” Agende Santos, the band’s bass player, was born in 1982 in the South Bronx.  He started playing at 12 years of age, borrowing a bass at school.  At home he collaborated with his brother Lenny experimenting with rhythms in duo, bass and guitar.  Max was always a rock lover and thus brings elements of rock into Aventura’s sound.  Max is also an excellent rap artist and is featured on the album LOVE & HATE on a track entitled “Don’t Waste My Time” and with Nina Sky on the GOD’S PROJECT track “You’re Lying.”  Mikey and Lenny have prepared a solo hip hop project and hope to arrange for its release later this year.\n\nHenry Santos Jeter, singer and composer, was born on September 15, 1979 in Moca, Dominican Republic.  As a youngster Henry was already a diehard music fanatic.  He moved with his family to New York at age 14, where he continued to develop his musical skills.  He subsequently joined a band called Los Teenagers with his cousin Anthony, a group which later morphed into Aventura.  Henry is the group’s comedian, delighting the audience with spontaneous antics on stage.  He is also a hard working business person with a myriad of creative projects on the front burner, including an excellent bachata group, The Hustleheartz aka Los Robacorazones.","booking_agent":"Angelo Medina","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":409552132394237,"source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/s720x720/430248_409552132394237_72718196_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Bronx","general_manager":"Johnny Marines","genre":"Latin","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Bronx","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8133852,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Aventura","name":"Aventura","press_contact":"nanettelamboy@aol.com","record_label":"Premium Latin / Sony","release_date":"New Album 2014","talking_about_count":114643,"username":"Aventura","website":"www.aventuraworldwide.com www.twitter.com/aventura www.youtube.com/aventura www.myspace.com/kobkingsofbachata","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Fergie","id":"5645523675","info":{"id":"5645523675","about":"Success is in the journey.","app_id":"0","bio":"Stacy Ann Ferguson began her career in 1983 as the voice of Sally Brown in the children's cartoon series Charlie Brown. Shortly afterwards, at the age of eight, she made her first appearance on the variety television program Kids Incorporated. During the following five years, Ferguson appeared on over 100 episodes of Kids Incorporated, some of which alongside Renee Sands, with whom she would later reunite in the band Wild Orchid.\n\nIn 1993, Ferguson graduated from Glen A. Wilson High School in Hacienda Heights, California.\n\nIn 1990 Ferguson became a member of the all-female band Wild Orchid. The group released two albums, but after completing their third album the record label declined to release it. During Wild Orchid, she was a Bongo model, and Guess model and had her own show called \"The Great Pretenders\", on Fox Family. She left the group shortly thereafter and, according to interviews, sought therapy. She told a Glasgow newspaper: \"I started doing Ecstasy. Then I got addicted to crystal methamphetamine. My weight dropped to 90 lb (41 kg). I lied to my friends and said I was bulimic.

Ferguson replaced background singer Kim Hill, who left the group in 2000. Ferguson recorded five songs with the group before she was invited to join them permanently. She took the stage name \"Fergie\" and is featured prominently in the group's songs \"Shut Up\" and \"My Humps\".\n\nFerguson is embarking on a solo career, but she has said she considers it only a side project and will still continue to record and tour with the band.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151620827933676","source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/946624_10151620827933676_416289737_n.jpg","offset_y":54,"offset_x":0},"description":"Instagram: http://instagram.com/fergie\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fergie\nWebsite: http://fergie.com/","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Hacienda Heights, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":9940031,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/fergie","name":"Fergie","record_label":"Interscope Records","talking_about_count":113620,"username":"fergie","website":"http://www.fergie.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Nirvana","id":"49436315526","info":{"id":"49436315526","about":"www.nirvana.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Kurt Cobain\nKrist Novoselic\nDave Grohl","bio":"Nirvana was an American rock band that was formed by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.\n\nWith the lead single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from the group's second album Nevermind (1991), Nirvana entered into the mainstream, bringing along with it a subgenre of alternative rock called grunge. Other Seattle grunge bands such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden also gained popularity, and, as a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the United States during the early-to-middle 1990s. As Nirvana's frontman, Kurt Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of \"Generation X\". Cobain was uncomfortable with the attention and placed his focus on the band's music, challenging the band's audience with its third studio album In Utero (1993).\n\nNirvana's brief run ended with Cobain's death in April 1994, but the band's popularity continued in the years that followed. More than eight years later, \"You Know You're Right\", an unfinished demo from the band's final recording session, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold over fifty million albums worldwide.

Download on iTunes: http://bit.ly/paradiseitunes","app_id":"0","bio":"“Your first album, it’s a big moment,” says Cody Simpson.  “It’s a milestone in your career.  It’s giving a lot of yourself to the world.”\n\nWith over 3.4 million Twitter followers and 3.3 million Facebook likes – not to mention over 150 million YouTube views – it’s clear that the world wants a lot more of Cody Simpson.  Now, with the long awaited arrival of his full-length debut album, “PARADISE,” the Queensland, Australia-born singer/songwriter is ready to soar even higher.  With a refreshing blend of contemporary high-energy and acoustic guitar-driven beach pop songs like “Wish U Were Here (Feat. Becky G)” and “Got Me Good” Simpson is revealed as much more than just a worldwide multimedia phenomenon – he’s a distinctive and original artist with his own lane.\n\n“That’s so hard to do in pop music, which is why I took my time,” says Simpson.  “When people listen to it, they’ll really hear me.  They’ll be able to say ‘That’s Cody Simpson.  That’s what he sounds like.’”\n\n“PARADISE” was recorded throughout the first half of 2012, all part of a non-stop schedule that includes school, recording, touring, and countless TV and promotional appearances.  Despite the constant activity, the Los Angeles-based Simpson determinedly took his time making the record, accumulating more and more life experience with each day.\n\n“I felt that I didn’t really have enough to say,” Simpson explains, “but I’ve learned so much recently. I’ve grown up a bit. Having traveled the world I feel like I have a lot more to write about.”\n\nSimpson – who co-wrote most of “PARADISE” – was joined in the studio by a veritable who’s-who of modern pop hitmakers, including Dr. Luke & Cirkut (Katy Perry, Flo Rida, Ke$ha), Adam Messinger & Nasri (Justin Bieber, Chris Brown), John Ryan (One Direction, Jennifer Lopez), Colby O’Donis (Lady Gaga), Drew Pearson (Zac Brown Band, Phillip Phillips), Dwayne “Supa Dups” Chin-quee (Bruno Mars, Drake, Eminem), Jonathan Bellion, Alex Dezen & Chris Morris, and The Futuristics (Chris Brown, The Lonely Island Feat. Justin Timberlake & Lady Gaga).  Cody views his work with such heavyweight talent to be a kind of college of musical knowledge.\n\n“They have their vibe, I have my vibe, then we get in the studio and mix the two,” Simpson says.  “It’s cool to work with so many different artists because I get to take different inspirations and learn new things, it makes me a better artist.  I’m always looking to improve, to make the best music I can for my fans.”\n\nSimpson – who co-wrote much of the album – cites the influence of such artists as Jason Mraz, John Mayer, and Jack Johnson on songs such as “Got Me Good” and the ebullient title track.  The chill vibes and sweet surfside spirit represent Simpson’s deep connection to his native Gold Coast of Australia.\n\n“Paradise, for me, is home,” Simpson says.  “I only get to go home maybe twice a year, so when I do go home, it really feels like paradise.  That’s the great thing about paradise; it’s pretty much whatever you want it to be.  Everybody who listens to this record will have a different vision of paradise.”\n\nMusic played an integral part in Simpson’s life right from the start.  Seeing his dad sing and play guitar for friends and family at parties and backyard barbecues taught him the incredible power of music to bring people together.  Inspired, he asked for his own guitar and began taking lessons at the age of seven.\n\nAfter learning but a few chords, Cody wrote his first song.  He continued practicing and soon began posting YouTube videos of himself performing his original songs alongside stellar covers by such favorite artists as Justin Timberlake, Jason Mraz, and The Jacksons.  Simpson’s YouTube Channel quickly created a worldwide commotion, receiving millions upon millions of views following its August 2008 debut. \n\nIn April 2010, Simpson released his irresistible debut single, “iYiYi (Feat. Flo Rida),” and immediately began winning over U.S. fans with a series of live performances, including 2010’s Camplified tour of over 30 different summer camps across the country. Cody’s debut EP, entitled “4 U,” arrived in December 2010, highlighted by both “iYiYi” and the rhythmic pop of “All Day,” which rose to #1 on Radio Disney’s “Top 30 Countdown.” \n\nIn summer 2011, Simpson made a stunning chart debut as his “COAST TO COAST” EP entered the SoundScan/Billboard 200 at #12.  “The EP highlighted by the hit single, “On My Mind,” which proved a top 40 favorite at Pop radio outlets nationwide, having also hit #1 at Radio Disney (his second chart-topper at the network).  The “On My Mind” companion video – directed by Travis Kopach (Panic! At The Disco, 3OH!3, Boys Like Girls) – is also a certified YouTube blockbuster with over 14 million views and counting at Cody’s official YouTube channel.  \n\nA truly charming and charismatic live performer, Simpson has toured nearly non-stop, including his sold out “Welcome to Paradise” headline tour, co-headline tours with Big Time Rush and shows alongside Justin Bieber, Carly Rae Jepsen and appearances at such events as the 2011 & 2012 White House Easter Egg Roll, the Arthur Ashe Kids Day festivities at the 2011 U.S. Open.  Cody’s own “Coast To Coast Tour” of U.S. malls drew huge crowds everywhere it went in 2011, with more than 3,000 fans turning out at each of its 10 stops to see the rising teen star in action. \n\nCody has also made a remarkable array of high profile TV appearances, including NBC’s The Today Show, ABC’s Live! with Kelly, ABC’s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,  Nickelodeon’s Bucket & Skinner’s Epic Adventures, The Disney Channel’s So Random, CBS Saturday Early Show, and the nationally syndicated Ellen DeGeneres Show, not to mention as a performer and mentor on Radio Disney and the Disney Channel’s “N.B.T. (Next Big Thing)” talent contest.  In addition, Simpson was among the top stars featured at Nickelodeon’s 2012 Kids Choice Awards where he presented and took home the award for “Favorite Aussie Star,” and at Australian Nickelodeon’s 2011 Kids Choice Awards, where he won awards in a trio of categories, including “Awesome Aussie,” “Aussie Muso,” and the prestigious “Super Fresh.” Cody was also profiled in a range of national publications, while also receiving extensive TV coverage including E! News and Access Hollywood. \n\nAs if all that weren’t enough, Simpson also starred in the 2012 original film, Finding Cody. Presented by Warner Music Group’s original YouTube Channel, “The Warner Sound,” Finding Cody made history as the first interactive YouTube movie featuring a major musical artist.  While he enjoys such extracurricular creative activities, Simpson is firmly focused on one aspect of his art above all.\n\n“My music is way above everything else right now except maybe school,” he says.  “I’m really focused on being the best artist and performer I can right now.  Definitely, in the future, I’m interested in acting and fashion, but right now I’m taking it one step at a time.  I don’t want to rush things.”\n\nThe delightfully idiosyncratic “PARADISE” confirms Cody Simpson as a major recording artist and a unique new voice in modern pop music.  With a full-scale AEG promoted North American tour in support of “PARADISE” scheduled to get underway in February 2013 and a November European tour nearly already nearly sold out, things are about to get even more intense for Cody Simpson. \n\n“There’s so much going on right now,” he says, “it’s just a crazy whirlwind. I’m super-stoked and definitely ready for it.”","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151484961177670","source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/945866_10151484961177670_868005449_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Gold Coast, Australia","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4823960,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/codysimpsonmusic","name":"Cody Simpson","record_label":"Atlantic Records","talking_about_count":112518,"username":"codysimpsonmusic","website":"http://www.codysimpson.com http://store.codysimpson.com/ http://www.twitter.com/codysimpson http://www.youtube.com/codysimpsonmusic http://www.myspace.com/codysimpsonmusic","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Kelly Clarkson","id":"18481194560","info":{"id":"18481194560","about":"GREATEST HITS - CHAPTER ONE Available Now","app_id":"0","band_members":"Kelly Clarkson","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151513459074561","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/579036_10151513459074561_1763744332_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Burleson, TX","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8541810,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/kellyclarkson","name":"Kelly Clarkson","record_label":"RCA","talking_about_count":111080,"username":"kellyclarkson","website":"www.kellyclarkson.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","id":"8335563918","info":{"id":"8335563918","about":"www.redhotchilipeppers.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Anthony Kiedis\nFlea\nChad Smith\nJosh Klinghoffer","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150689746603919","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/558531_10150689746603919_410758997_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"description":"Flea on Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/flea333  \nFlea on Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/flea\nChad on Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/RHCPchad\nChad on Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/RHCPChad","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":22577083,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/ChiliPeppers","name":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","talking_about_count":110310,"username":"ChiliPeppers","website":"http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com/ http://www.twitter.com/chilipeppers http://www.facebook.com/chilipeppers http://www.google.com/+RedHotChiliPeppers","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Tyga","id":"11592717710","info":{"id":"11592717710","about":"Official YouTube - http://youtube.com/tyga\n\n2013 - Hotel California :: http://itun.es/i6JW996\n2012 - Careless World :: http://itun.es/iSk8Km","app_id":"0","awards":"Grammy Nominated for \"Deuces\" Best Rap Song Collaboration - 2011","band_members":"Tyga","bio":"Not long ago - Tyga (born Michael Stevenson) was just another kid from the hood struggling to rise above the negativity that surrounded him. Born and raised in the infamous Compton, CA armed with nothing but an amateur mixtape and hunger, he built solid local buzz through impressive live shows and an online hustle. Still, a kid with lofty dreams wondered if he’d ever catch that “big break”. Then one day a conversation at a popular LA sneaker store changed everything.\nIn the aisle of Flight Club LA he and Travis McCoy from Gym Class Heroes had a debate that switched from ranking the greatest Jordans ever to the greatest rappers. \"We started talking about music and I got enough courage to give him my little mixtape\" Tyga says. \"He was telling me all this stuff he was doing with his band and I thought he was just lying to seem cool. Then one day I saw him on MTV, then I started hitting him up on AIM non stop!\" he says with a chuckle.  \"Next thing you know I'm on tour with him going all over the world. It was crazy.\" Travis relates “I can see myself at his age whenever I watch him perform. It’s an innocence and a sense of urgency a lot of artists today lack and it’s an honor for me to welcome him to the inner circle”. Travis signed Tyga to his Bat Squad Records imprint. A bond had been made indeed.\n\nTyga soon became an unofficial part of Gym Class Hero’s crew and his undeniable presence would be felt at various events, appearances and shows. People began to wonder “who is this kid?” His charismatic swagger gave off the aura of a star while he patiently waited for his real chance to shine. \n\nThat moment came at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The night before the show Tyga found out that he would be perform the \"Arms Race\" remix with Fall Out Boy alongside Travis and Lil Wayne. Unexpectedly thrust into such a huge arena, most young artists would crumble under the pressure. Instead, Tyga stepped up and traded vocal jabs on a stage full of pop-culture heavyweights in front of millions of viewers. The star had arrived.\n\nThoroughly impressed by the youngster's gusto, Tyga and Weezy became fast friends. Wayne remembers “At rehearsal I thought he was just a stand in, but when the cameras were rolling I realized he wasn’t playing around”. Soon, Tyga would find himself in the studio with the self-proclaimed \"greatest rapper alive\" laying down verses for an appearance on the most anticipated album in years - Lil Wayne's The Carter 3. \n\nAnother famous musician known for his ability to spot talent - Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz also took notice. He was so excited he suggested his label Decaydance team up with Bat Squad on a release for Tyga. “Gym Class’ success has opened a lot of new doors for us, “ Pete says “Yeah, it’s different but I think it’d be pretty lame if I only put out stuff that I thought everybody loves or gets. To me this is the future.”\n\nThe press has also taken notice with early mentions in Blender, AOL.com and MTV. VIBE magazine even declared him as one of the best undiscovered rappers in America. The fact that momentum has started rolling in Tyga’s favor has not been lost on the humble artist. “I truly am blessed to have such great people believing in me. I’m real lucky and I can’t wait to get out there and make everyone proud. I just gotta stay positive, keep my faith in God and I know things will turn out great” \n\nTyga’s aptly titled debut album NO INTRODUCTION is set for release this spring. The lead single -  “Coconut Juice” - produced by SAM & Sluggo (Gym Class Heroes, Method Man) is a track just screaming to take over radio. Tyga explains the meaning behind the unusual phrase “I don’t drink alcohol, so at parties I would just walk around with a cup mixed with whatever else I could find. When people asked what I was sipping on I would say ‘coconut juice’ because it sounded funny. So I made a song about it.” The album also features diverse production from Patrick Stump (Fall Out Boy, The Roots, Lupe Fiasco) and Stress (Ghostface Killah, Cassidy) as well as appearances by Stump, Travis, & Lil Wayne.

Lo cierto es, que ahora que estoy aquí y no sé bien donde me encuentro, me encuentro más seguro que nunca, ubicado en ninguna parte pero con un ejército de sueños, todos por delante. \n\nHarto de ser parte del séquito triste de los que se quejan y se quedan allí, me propuse intentar hacer las cosas por las que me quejaba para ver si en efecto eran tan simples como las pensaba.\n\nNo se trata de un ajuste de cuentas ni de una cátedra de nada, es sólo ese afán carente de metáforas y estructuras que me lleva al lugar que pretendía que fuera cálido como mi primer casa uterina donde no me faltaba nada y sólo dependía del más grande amor de mi vida. \n\nTengo los zapatos que me gustan y los uso porque me gustan y me vienen cómodos, no porque los necesito para pertenecer a ningún grupo.

Blige, Ghostface, Jennifer Hudson","bio":"Grammy-Award winner Ne-Yo, who has impressed audiences with his talents since his 2006 with his multi-platinum, chart topping debut, In My Own Words, is fed-up with the sloppiness of current R&B. \"Years ago, if you weren't wearing the right suit or have a correct crease in your pants, you couldn't even get in the door--let alone on stage to perform.\"\n\nWith Ne-Yo's third disc, Year of the Gentleman, the Las Vegas native and premier songwriter has constructed a suite of songs that shows exactly what he means by class.  Written over the course of travels through Europe last year and influenced by his own fascination with the Rat Pack, Ne-Yo explains, \"For me, the sharpness of Sammy and Sinatra is the kind of style I strive for in clothes and music. Year of the Gentleman is named in honor of those guys.\"\n\nLike the best artists, Ne-Yo's music has an eternal sound that appeals to fans of all ages. \"As a songwriter as well as a singer, I think it's important to cast my words wide. In other words, I am not trying to contain myself in some little box marked 'urban.' I have traveled the world, and\nI want to bring that across in the material. Forget about urban, pop or whatever, Year of the Gentleman is a worldly album.\"\n\nIn England, staying at his favorite hotel, the Courthouse, Ne-Yo would sometimes sit at the bar and write songs. \"It's funny, because the hotel used to be a real courthouse,\" he says. \"There was also a small jailhouse in there where supposedly David Bowie and Mick Jagger were both held at one time.\"\n\nNe-Yo proves on the first single \"Closer,\" it is possible to be classy and funky at the same time. Produced by Stargate, the track is an electro-excursion in the glam of Euro-disco. \"I just love the beat on that record,\" says Ne-Yo. \"When I was hanging-out in clubs in London, everything had energy. I wanted to merge that sound with American soul music, and 'Closer' is the end result.\"\n\nHarking back to a late-sixties retro sound, the beautiful \"So You Can Cry\" was one of the first songs Ne-Yo recorded for the project.  Opening with an enchanting guitar resembling soft rain, \"So You Can Cry\" is a heartbreaking tune about a friend mourning a break up.  \"This is a true story,\" explains Ne-Yo.  \"A friend of mine just broke up with her boyfriend and I said, 'Ok, take this moment to be sad.  I'll turn the sun away from you so you can cry today.\"\n\nEmbracing Lennon and McCartney with the same vigor as Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson, the amazing \"Stop This World\" should be hailed as one of the most beautiful love songs in years. When Ne-Yo swoons, \"She's got heaven in her eyes,\" there is no denying his passion.\n\n\"I don't know what puts certain ideas in my head when I'm writing,\" explains Ne-Yo. \"Sometimes I see a picture in a magazine, a painting in a museum or a word on a page, and that's all I need to trigger the thoughts.\"\n\nIn addition to penning this new collection, Ne-Yo once again showed his writing prowess, penning lyrics for Rihanna, Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige and Celine Dion as well as the chart topping, record breaking, Grammy nominated song \"Irreplaceable\" for Beyonce.\n\nAs well recording Year of the Gentleman, last year proved to be a very busy time for the young talent. He release his award winning album, toured nationally and made multiple appearances TV appearances including Christmas In Washington making an appearance in front of George Bush but he declined to attend the a meet & greet with the current President.  \n\nMoving beyond the competition by just being himself, Ne-Yo's Year of the Gentleman is right on time to usher in a new era of \"world music.\"","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151428729902012","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/s720x720/217081_10151428729902012_1051573132_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Atlanta, GA","description":"Ne-Yo - R.E.D. new album available now featuring \"Let Me Love You\" and \"Forever Now\" Biography: Grammy-Award winner ","genre":"R&B/Soul","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Las Vegas, NV","influences":"Michael Jackson, Prince, Stevie Wonder, Sammy Davis Jr., The Rat Pack","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":12285480,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Ne-Yo","name":"Ne-Yo","record_label":"Motown Records/ Compound Ent","talking_about_count":102630,"username":"Ne-Yo","website":"http://www.facebook.com/Ne-Yo","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Luis Fonsi","id":"11430503918","info":{"id":"11430503918","about":"www.luisfonsi.com www.twitter.com/luisfonsi www.myspace.com/luisfonsi www.facebook.com/luisfonsi","app_id":"0","bio":"Cuando el amor, la pasión y la música corren por las venas de un multifacético joven surge PALABRAS DEL SILENCIO. Así lleva por titulo la nueva producción discográfica del cantante, compositor, músico y productor puertorriqueño LUIS FONSI.\n\nEl álbum, una remuneración de años de incansable trabajo y constante desarrollo en el mundo de la música, muestra el potente y versátil registro vocal del cantautor.\n\nTras presentarse en los más importantes escenarios del mundo, Fonsi regresa al panorama musical con letras cargadas de emoción y sentimientos logrando plasmar en lo que el mismo ha llamado, “su disco más importante”.\n\nPALABRAS DEL SILENCIO presenta a un LUIS FONSI mucho más adentrado en la piel del compositor y productor. Y es que si la responsabilidad de ser un cantante que logre transmitir sus sentimientos con su voz es grande, la de componer y producir un proyecto en su totalidad pasa a ser inmensa.\n\nPero como de retos se ha tratado su carrera musical, que este año celebra su décimo aniversario, tras el éxito de su pasado disco “Paso a Paso”, Fonsi no tuvo reparo alguno en alejarse del estudio de grabación y tomarse el tiempo necesario. Tres años necesitó para la creación y desarrollo de este nuevo disco, definitivamente el más internacional de su equipaje discográfico. \n\nSeguramente, todos los que a través del pasado han apostado a este talentoso puertorriqueño y que lo han hecho merecedor de importantes reconocimientos, tales como, Artista Pop Masculino del Año en Premios Lo Nuestro” en dos ocasiones consecutivas y hasta el máximo galardón de la Gaviota de Oro en el importante festival musical de Viña del Mar, no tendrán que preocuparse.\n\nLUIS FONSI asegura que esos pasos firmes, destacando entre ellos la majestuosa e impactante presentación en los premios Grammy Latino junto al guitarrista de ZZ Top, Billy F Gibbons, definitivamente le han permitido confiar que el mundo de la música es lo suyo, tal y como lo descubrió desde su niñez.\n\nChristina Aguilera, Laura Pausini, Wisín y Yandel, José Feliciano y Olga Tañón también lo han creído así, razón por la que le han invitado a acompañarle con su potente voz en duetos confiando en su talento para unir sus sentimientos en una sola canción.\n\nIgualmente lo confirman los múltiples discos de Oro y Platino en mercados como Puerto Rico, Estados Unidos, Venezuela, Chile y España, entre otros; y los número uno en la prestigiosa publicación de Billboard gracias a temas como ‘Nada Es Para Siempre’, ‘Imagíname Sin Ti’, ‘Abrazar La Vida’ y ‘Tu Amor’. Son esas mismas canciones algunas de las responsables de la venta de millones de discos a nivel internacional.\n\nEl cantante es egresado de la prestigiosa Escuela de Música de Florida State University, donde culminó su formación profesional en música. Como compositor ha contado con la confianza de importantes figuras del pentagrama musical, tales como Olga Tañón, Víctor Manuelle y Ednita Nazario quienes han seleccionado sus canciones para que formen parte de sus producciones discográficas. Con cada uno ha compartido su don para la composición y producción de temas que en sólo semanas se han convertido en grandes éxitos radiales acaparando importantes posiciones en la lista Billboard.\n\nLuego de tres años sin presentar una entrega inédita, LUIS FONSI está más que preparado para recorrer con esa energía incansable que lo caracteriza, grandes plazas internacionales como lo son su natal Puerto Rico, Estados Unidos, México, Sur América, Centro América y España.\n\nCon \"No Me Doy Por Vencido\", primer sencillo de sexto proyecto discográfico, Fonsi escala rápidamente las listas de Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico, España, México y Latinoamérica. La canción debutó en el puesto #5 entre las más escuchadas del chart Pop Latino y es la canción NUMERO UNO de la radio en PUERTO RICO, además, de ingresar en la cartelera Top 10 del Hot Latin Songs que publica BDS en la revista Billboard. Mientras, en México, España y Latinoamérica su debut radial también ha sido impresionante. \n\nPALABRAS DEL SILENCIO, co-producido por los ganadores de premios Grammy®, Sebastian Krys, Armando Ávila, Jacobo Calderón y el propio Luis Fonsi, estará disponible el 26 de Agosto en formatos CD, CD+DVD, móvil y digital.\n\n###\n\nwww.universalmusica.com\n\nwww.luisfonsi.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151385083358919","source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/407590_10151385083358919_145858603_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Puerto Rico","genre":"Latin","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Miami/San Juan P.R.","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8127663,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/luisfonsi","name":"Luis Fonsi","record_label":"Universal Music Latino","talking_about_count":102529,"username":"luisfonsi","website":"www.luisfonsi.com www.twitter.com/luisfonsi www.myspace.com/luisfonsi www.imeem.com/luisfonsi www.universalmusica.com/luisfonsi","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Yo!

We Dance. We Steal Things. The album featured the record breaking “I’m Yours” – a buoyant, reggae-flavored love song which captured the hearts of people across the globe, surpassing twenty-one million sales worldwide and setting a record for the longest-running song in the 51-year history of Billboard’s Hot 100 chart with 76 weeks on the chart. The track earned Jason a Grammy “Song of the Year” nomination, was ASCAP’s 2010 “Song of the Year” and led to Mraz being given the Songwriters Hall of Fame’s prestigious “Hal David Starlight Award,” which is presented to songwriters who have made a significant impact in the music industry with their original songs. In 2010, Jason garnered two Grammy wins to add to his long list of accomplishments winning “Best Male Pop Vocal Performance” for “Make It Mine” and “Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals” for “Lucky,” his duet with Colbie Caillat, both from We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.\n\nThough the album had a major effect on the public and the music industry, it had the biggest impact on Mraz himself, propelling the Virginia-born singer and songwriter to international stardom and creating touring demand across the world playing everywhere from Carnegie Hall to the Sydney Opera House to stadiums around the globe – a sweet invitation for this socially conscious and environmentally minded artist whose mission is to celebrate music’s lasting power to inspire change and help others through global citizenship.\n\nMraz spent 22 months on the road promoting We Sing, which followed on his previous studio albums, the 2002 debut Waiting For My Rocket To Come and 2005’s Mr. A-Z. “The tour was a blast and a whirlwind,” he says. “I got turned on to the power of the voice and the power of the melody, and it created this desire in me to do it again immediately. Being able to inspire people and take a very simple message global gave me a preview of what that can do. I got home from the tour and thought, ‘How can I spread love to the world through this new platform that I have?’ That became my starting point for this new album.” That album, Love Is A Four Letter Word, contains a heartfelt, uplifting collection that explores love’s ups and downs or as Mraz puts it: “What one does in love to make it work, and what one does in love when it’s time to let go.”","booking_agent":"Jonathan Adelman @ Paradigm (North America, South America, Asia, and Australia); Emma Banks @ CAA (rest of world)","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151289500470698","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/525741_10151289500470698_1561159777_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"general_manager":"Bill Silva & Patrick Pocklington @ Bill Silva Management","genre":"Healing & EasyListening / Surf / Gospel","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"San Diego, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":12249159,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/JasonMraz","name":"Jason Mraz","press_contact":"Atlantic Records: Sheila Richman & Ashley White (National); Marisa Bianco (Tour/Online)","record_label":"Atlantic Records","talking_about_count":99193,"username":"JasonMraz","website":"http://jasonmraz.com http://twitter.com/jason_mraz http://youtube.com/officialjasonmraz http://youtube.com/theofficialjasonmraz http://jasonmraz.tumblr.com http://google.com/+JasonMraz http://smarturl.it/mrazapp http://smarturl.it/mrazappandroid","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"BIGBANG","id":"105230856200588","info":{"id":"105230856200588","about":"2012 BIGBANG Live Concert: Alive Tour in Seoul (Live)\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/AliveTour2012","app_id":"0","band_members":"G-Dragon/GD/지드래곤 (leader, vocal, rap, composition)\nTaeyang/SOL/태양 (vocal, rap)\nT.O.P/탑/최승현 (vocal, rap)\nDaesung/D-Lite/대성 (vocal) \nSeungri/V.I./승리 (vocal)","bio":"Since their debut in 2006, BIGBANG have worked hard to establish themselves as cultural icons, rather than just another boy band. G-Dragon, TOP, TAEYANG, DAESUNG, and SEUNGRI have set themselves apart from their peers by self-producing many of their hit songs, from the early classics “Last Farewell”, “Haru Haru”, “Sunset Glow”, and “Lies” to more recent chart-toppers such as “Tonight” and “Fantastic Baby”. BIGBANG are trendsetters of the Korean music scene, having considerable influence on both music and fashion alike. They did away with the stereotypical stage costumes often worn by other singers in favor of clothing that is reflective of each member’s unique personality. G-Dragon, TOP, TAEYANG, DAESUNG, and SEUNGRI have all engaged in solo activities that utilize their individual and distinctive talents as singers, MCs and actors to thrive in every area of the entertainment world. All five members are as equally successful in their respective solo efforts as they are as a group, which is a further proof of their endless talents. In 2011, BIGBANG returned to the music scene after a two-year hiatus with the release of their 4th mini-album “Tonight,” which received great reviews from fans and critics alike. They immediately followed up with that successful come-back by releasing their latest mini-album, “ALIVE” in 2012. “ALIVE” is the perfect display of BIGBANG’s growth and maturity as singers and producers over the course of their career and is a testament of their efforts to continuously progress, rather than resting at the top of the music scene.\n\nG-Dragon, TOP, 태양, 대성, 승리로 구성된 빅뱅은 2006년 데뷔한 이후 단순한 보이밴드가 아닌 하나의 문화적 아이콘으로 자리매김했다. 데뷔 당시부터 자체 프로듀싱을 통한 곡들을 발표해 온 빅뱅은 2007년 발표한 ´거짓말´ 이후 ´마지막 인사´ ´하루하루´ ´붉은 노을´ ´Tonight´ 등 수많은 히트곡을 연달아 선보이면서 일약 국민 그룹으로 발돋움했다.\n빅뱅은 음악뿐만 패션에서도 큰 영향을 미치며 국내 가요계의 흐름을 바꿔놨다. 기존 가수들이 선보이던 무대의상의 고정관념을 깨고 일상생활에서도 입고 싶은 스타일의 의상을 선보이면서 음악과 패션에서 트렌드를 이끌어 가고 있다. 또한, 음악, 연기, 예능, 뮤지컬 등 다양한 분야에서 멤버 개개인의 재능을 살린 솔로 활동을 통해 각자의 매력을 충분히 어필하고 있어 그룹으로도 솔로 아티스트로서도 모든 멤버가 골고루 인기를 얻고 있다. 최근에는 2년만에 미니4집을 발표해 더욱 성숙된 음악으로 컴백, 최고의 자리에 있음에도 멈추지 않고 계속해서 발전해나가는 모습을 보이며 호평을 받았다.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":503665393023797,"source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/563330_503665393023797_792572163_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"description":"[DISCOGRAPHY]\n2013

This is Carrie's only account on Facebook.","bio":"With more than 15 million albums sold worldwide, 16 #1 singles, with seven as co-writes, five Grammys, and countless other accolades---all achieved with four albums in less than eight years---some artists might feel as though they’d earned the right to rest on their laurels, but not Carrie Underwood. Fueled by a restless creative spirit, good-natured competitive streak and abundance of God-given talent, Carrie unleashes her most ambitious project yet with Blown Away.\n\nTeaming again with producer Mark Bright, Carrie delivers a 14-song collection that covers a particularly vast expanse of emotional territory. She celebrates the understated pleasures of small town living in “Thank God for Hometowns” and explores the exquisite fragility of life in “Forever Changed.” She’s not averse to tackling abuse and betrayal then doling out a little sweet revenge with such compelling tracks as “Blown Away” and “Two Black Cadillacs.” Musically the songs range from rollicking up-tempo anthems, such as the hit first single “Good Girl” to the island-flavored escape of “One Way Ticket” and the steel guitar-laced country lament of “Wine After Whiskey.”\n\nSuch musical and lyrical diversity is the foundation of Carrie’s artistry. After all, this is a young woman who has performed with Steven Tyler on a top-rated edition of CMT’s “Crossroads,” scored a No. 1 country hit with good friend Brad Paisley on “Remind Me,” and sang with the iconic Tony Bennett on the 2012 Grammy telecast, delivering the classic “It Had to be You,” their collaboration on Bennett’s Duets II album. \n   \nThe Oklahoma native is a fan of all types of music, yet she’s purposefully planted herself in the country format, even while her eclectic tastes have influenced her creative output. She’s been careful to not get pigeonholed and prides herself on not being predictable. “I feel like I’ve taken all of my albums into as many different directions as possible while still keeping them cohesive,” she says. “I love this album from start to finish and love every song on it. There’s not one single song that’s like another song I’ve ever done.  I think it’s my best album.  I really do think there’s something for everyone.”\n\nHer ability to be unique yet accessible has been crucial to Carrie’s career from the beginning.  She became America’s sweetheart in 2005 when she won the fourth season of American Idol, a vehicle that transformed her from a shy Oklahoma girl with a great voice to a budding superstar. Since then she’s become the popular franchise’s most successful alumni. \n\nShe’s won a vast array of awards including three female vocalist awards from both the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM). In 2010, when Carrie garnered her second win as ACM Entertainer of the Year, she became the first female artist to win the award twice, and only the 7th female to take the award in the 40-year history of the ACM category, among Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell, Reba McEntire, Shania Twain, and the Dixie Chicks. Carrie also received the ACM Triple Crown Award, thanks to her past wins for the categories of Entertainer of the Year, Top Female Vocalist and Top New Female Vocalist, which has been won by only one other female artist – Barbara Mandrell in 2004. In addition to the above, Carrie’s won 7 American Music Awards, 6 People’s Choice Awards, 9 CMT Music Awards, 9 American Country Awards, and 7 BMI Songwriter Awards. Carrie also received a Golden Globe nomination in 2010 for “Best Original Song” for “There’s A Place For Us” from Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader which she both recorded and co-wrote.\n\nCarrie’s 2005 debut Some Hearts topped Billboard’s Country Albums chart for 27 weeks, has sold over 7 million copies, and was voted #1 Country Album of the Decade by Billboard. Both her 2007 sophomore album, Carnival Ride and 2009’s Play On debuted at No. 1. Her current album, Blown Away, debuted atop the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, where it held the No. 1 spot for two consecutive weeks.  Over the course of four albums, she’s saturated country radio with such hits as “Jesus, Take the Wheel,” “Before He Cheats,” “So Small,” “Last Name,” “Just A Dream,” “Cowboy Casanova,” “Temporary Home,” “All-American Girl,” “Undo It,” “Mama’s Song,” “Good Girl,” and “Blown Away.”\n \nCarrie’s highly acclaimed concert tours have further helped to establish her into the elite status of the country music community, or in any genre of music, with her stellar performances. In 2008, after wrapping her “Carnival Ride Tour” she became the top selling country female touring artist of the year selling out many of the 137 shows before 1.2 million fans. In that year, Carrie also became the most-heard artist at country radio and was named the #1 Hot Country Songs Artist by Billboard and #1 Top Country Artist by Radio & Records.  In 2010, her next headline arena tour, the “Play On Tour,” played 108 shows with one million fans attending which resulted in Carrie being named again as the top-ranked female country touring artist of the year. Carrie is currently on her critically-acclaimed international “Blown Away Tour”, which began at London’s historic Royal Albert Hall, and continued throughout Australia, before launching in North America in September of 2012.\n\nCarrie is a proud member of the Grand Ole Opry and expanded her resume making her acting debut in the 2011 film “Soul Surfer.” She can be seen in print and TV ads as the North American face of Olay beauty products, and has a long-running deal with   vitaminwater®. One of Country Music’s most respected young ambassadors, Carrie has served as co-host of the CMA Awards with Brad Paisley the past five years.\n\nYet for those who think they know Carrie, Blown Away is likely to catch them by surprise, particularly the cinematic title track with its swirling, atmospheric production and intense lyric about abuse and revenge. “I got chills,” she says of the first time she heard the Josh Kear/Chris Tompkins penned stunner.   “I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager and said, ‘Do not let anyone else have this song. It’s my song’ . . . It’s such a visual song.  You listen to it and you can see everything that is happening. It’s so dramatic.  I’m not a drama person, but when you can make a movie in song form in 3 ½ minutes, it’s surreal.”\n\n“Blown Away” finds a daughter getting revenge on an abusive, alcoholic father and the next song, “Two Black Cadillacs,” also has a larger-than-life cinematic quality which makes both tunes feel like mini-movies set to music. “Two Black Cadillacs” relates the story of a wife and mistress who conspire to get even with the man who betrayed them both. “It’s just more drama,” says Carrie, who co-wrote the tune with Josh Kear and Hillary Lindsey. “It was so much fun creating all this drama and singing about it. That’s the great thing about being an entertainer; you’re just a big actor. When we start sitting down and writing songs, you just never know what’s going to come out.”\n\nCarrie co-wrote eight of the 14 songs on Blown Away, including the first single, Good Girl\" which reached number 1 on the country airplay charts and is certified platinum. ‘Good Girl’ was one of the last ones I wrote for the album,” she says of the tune she penned with Chris DeStefano and Ashley Gorley. “We wanted something a little more fun and up-tempo. Chris DeStefano is just a mad scientist with his Pro Tools and he can play every instrument.  We walked out of that writing session with a demo. It sounded awesome. It was ready to go. We let everybody hear it and everybody was so excited.”\n\n“Cupid’s Got a Shotgun” is another of the album’s high-energy tracks and it gets an extra kick from Paisley contributing his signature guitar licks. “Once we got into the studio, I was like Brad Paisley HAS to play on this. He’ll make the song,” Carrie says of the tune, she wrote with Kear and Tompkins. “We left so much space in the song for him to come in and play. He did his thing and sounded awesome. He added that last piece of the puzzle and it’s just so country.  It’s really cool.”\n\nIn addition to being musically inventive, Carrie has long been known for delivering songs with substance, and the new album delivers its share of potent messages. “Nobody Ever Told You,” which Carrie wrote with Luke Laird and Hillary Lindsey, boasts an empowering lyric and a breezy, engaging melody. “People need to hear compliments more,” she says of the song’s life-affirming lyric. “People need to hear ‘I love you’ more. People need to hear ‘You are beautiful’ more.”\n\n“Good in Goodbye,” co-written by Carrie, Lindsey and Ryan Tedder, is a bittersweet look at life beyond heartbreak that offers tender truth in the lines “As bad as it was/As bad as it hurt/I thank God I didn’t get what I thought I deserved.”  On the other end of the emotional spectrum, “Thank God for Hometowns” is a sweet salute to small town life. “I heard that one when I was going back to my 10 year high school reunion,” the Checotah, OK native says. “I listened to the demo when I was driving in to go stay with my parents. It was just very fitting in my heart at that time.” \n\n“Forever Changed” is a beautiful ballad that brings tears to Carrie’s eyes as she discusses it. “I had a hard time recording it and I still have a hard time listening to it,” she says of the Tom Douglas/Hillary Lindsey/James T. Slater penned ballad. “That is the most wonderfully well written song I’ve ever heard in my life. There’s this young girl meeting the love of her life, getting married and having a baby. It takes you back in time and there is something old fashioned about it. At the end, the mom’s obviously slipping a way a little bit. It is a sad song, but it’s not meant to be a sad song. It’s about love, being forever changed, forever loved.”\n\nIn a few short years, Carrie has seen the power music has to change lives---to incite dialog, to instill hope, and to simply entertain. She’s aware of the platform she’s been given. She respects it and appreciates every moment. “I’m very happy in my life and I count my blessings every day,” she says. “Seven years ago when I decided to try out for American Idol, my life changed completely in the blink of an eye. I went down a different train track and took off at about a million miles per hour. I feel like I’m still learning. In the beginning, it was like, ‘Oh, I have a No. 1. That’s awesome!’ I didn’t really understand what that meant. ‘Jesus, Take The Wheel’ and ‘Before He Cheats’ were No. 1 for several weeks, and that doesn’t happen often, but I had no idea. I realize now what hard work it actually is and I feel like I can appreciate those victories even more. Touring is more fun because I know what it’s like to headline a tour. I feel like I’m able to be more and more creative all the time. I always feel like I’m taking steps forward.” ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150778627504568","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/538779_10150778627504568_516370232_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Country","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Checotah, OK","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8696369,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/carrieunderwood","name":"Carrie Underwood","record_label":"Arista Nashville","talking_about_count":97017,"username":"carrieunderwood","website":"carrieunderwoodofficial.com ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Avenged Sevenfold","id":"8308655582","info":{"id":"8308655582","about":"Website: http://avengedsevenfold.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/theofficiala7x\nYouTube: http://youtube.com/avengedsevenfold\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/theofficiala7x\nTumblr: http://theofficiala7x.tumblr.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"M.

Nevertheless, it didn't take long for M. Shadows (vocals), Zacky Vengeance (guitar), Synyster Gates (guitar), the Reverend (drums), and Johnny Christ (bass) to make an impression with their aggressive hybrid of metal, hard rock, and punk-pop. The band made its official debut in July 2001, releasing Sounding the Seventh Trumpet on the Good Life label before moving to the Hopeless roster for 2003's Waking the Fallen. Warner Bros. took interest in the band's aggressive sound and issued its breakthrough release, City of Evil, in June 2005. The album reached number 30 on Billboard's Top 200, propelled in part by the Top Ten success of the single \"Bat Country.\" The accompany music video was heavily rotated on MTV and Fuse, where live appearances also helped boost Avenged's growing profile, and the band ultimately won the Best New Artist Award (though they were hardly newcomers) at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nAs demand for their music increased, Avenged Sevenfold canceled their tour dates for fall 2006 and set to work on a fourth studio album. Boasting a grittier sound than previous releases, the self-titled/self-produced disc appeared in October 2007, debuting at number four on the Billboard Top 200 and spinning off the radio single \"Almost Easy.\" The album also fared well in England, where three songs cracked the Top Five of the U.K. rock charts, and Avenged Sevenfold helped support the release by touring North America on the Taste of Chaos tour. Released in September 2008, the CD/DVD package Live in the LBC and Diamonds in the Rough captured the band during a tour stop in Long Beach. In 2009 the band announced plans to begin work on its third studio release. That same year, drummer Jimmy “The Rev” Sullivan passed away at the age of 28.

Su carrera los ha llevado a varios países de Latinoamérica, Estados Unidos y España.\nActualmente Jesse & Joy se encuentran en uno de los puntos más altos de su carrera, con su tercer álbum de estudio “¿Con Quién Se Queda El Perro?” han superado sus propios records y se han mantenido en los primeros lugares de ventas y de popularidad no solo en México sino a nivel internacional.\n\nMás de 25 millones de views tiene el video de “Corre” (segundo sencillo de este nuevo álbum) en YouTube y eso es sólo una muestra del éxito que ha alcanzado lo que seguramente es ya la canción del año, misma que ha superado las 12 semanas en la posición #1 de las listas de audiencia de radio en México. Este tema rápidamente se ha esparcido por toda la región y está siendo ya un suceso internacional.\n\nCarrera profesional\n\nJesse & Joy tenían 18 y 15 años respectivamente en el año 2001 cuando escribieron “Llegaste Tú”, en ese momento no imaginaron que unos años después este tema llamaría la atención de Warner Music México y en 2005 firmarían un contrato discográfico que comenzaría con el lanzamiento de su primer álbum de estudio “Esta Es Mi Vida” en el año 2006.\n\nEste álbum los lanzó a los primeros lugares de audiencia y a ganar premios como los artistas revelación de ese año. “Esta Es Mi Vida” logró la certificación de Disco de Platino en México y los hizo acreedores al premio Grammy como Mejor Artista Nuevo en el año 2007. Este álbum también marcó la pauta para un éxito internacional tocando varios países de Latinoamérica y Estados Unidos.\n\nDespués de un espectacular debut Jesse & Joy lanzan al mercado su segundo álbum de estudio “Electricidad” en el año 2009 el cual los consolida como el dueto de hermanos más prolífico en la música de México. Su segunda entrega logra la certificación de Disco de Oro y nuevamente los lleva a los lugares más altos de la audiencia no solo en México sino en otros países.\n\n¿Con Quién Se Queda El Perro? es el nombre del tercer álbum de Jesse & Joy el cual se lanzó al mercado en octubre de 2011, fue grabado en marzo del mismo año en Londres, la producción fue realizada por Martin Terefe quien por primera vez trabajó con una banda latina y en su carrera destacan sus colaboraciones con Paul McCartney, Jason Mraz, James Morrison, Craig David, Cat Stevens, KT Tunstall, entre otros. Con Martin refinaron su sonido, en su madurez como compositores elaboraron letras aún más agudas y supieron unir el ingenio con las cosas más sencillas y valiosas de la vida. En Londres, también trabajaron con el equipo de ingenieros que hicieron el disco \"In Rainbows\" de Radiohead y co-escribieron versiones de sus canciones en inglés con compositores que colaboraron en el último disco de Adele.\n\nEl primer sencillo que se cortó de este álbum se titula “Me Voy” y marcó un regreso contundente del dueto mexicano a las radios nacionales, pero sólo era un aviso de lo que vendría con el segundo sencillo “Corre”. Este tema ha llevado a Jesse & Joy a una posición privilegiada en la escena musical actual colocándolos actualmente como los artistas #1 del pop.\n\nMás de 12 semanas en la posición #1 de radio y más de 9 semanas con el video en #1 han mantenido a “¿Con Quién Se Queda El Perro?” en la lista de los discos más vendidos en México desde su lanzamiento. Este álbum logró la certificación de Disco de Platino en México a las pocas semanas de haberse lanzado al mercado.\n\nMás pronto de lo que se esperaba este último proyecto de Jesse & Joy está propagándose por toda Latinoamérica y Estados Unidos. Sin duda será el disco del año en habla hispana y sin duda consolidará al dúo de hermanos como uno de los referentes más importantes y propositivos del pop en español.\n\nPara mayor información de Jesse & Joy ingresar a:\n\nwww.jesseyjoy.com\n@jesseyjoy & @solamentejoy\nwww.youtube.com/jesseyjoyoficial\nwww.facebook.com/JesseyJoyOficial\n","booking_agent":"Booking y Contrataciones: ACShows Ana Garcia: (+5255) 53372034, (+5255) 53372020 EXT. 114 y 177, Nextel: 52 *7867*26, agarcia@westwoodent.com Label Manager: Mike Angel Hernandez: mikehernandez@westwoodent.com, manquenada@gmail.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151235542867824","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/s720x720/970668_10151235542867824_1326625669_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":25},"current_location":"Mexico D.F.","description":"“Me voy” es el primer sencillo de este tercer álbum que llevará por título: ¿Con quién se queda el perro?

Icons. Idols. These are the words used to describe those rare bands that have been adored for a lifetime and immortalized as distinct creators of rock and roll. But what these reverent words are missing is the notion of now. How do you reconcile a generation-spanning word like icon with the quick beat of the present? Aerosmith does it. The band members are legends, icons and idols, dynamic in the present; as cool and innovative now as they were thirty years ago. They are a phenomenon, a force of nature, trail-blazing, unstoppable, showing no signs of slowing down.Unique even among the select handful of rock bands who are still active after their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Aerosmith has sold over 100 million albums.\n\nThink for a second about how big a number that is and how many people have heard their music. Huge! Steven Tyler on vocals, Joe Perry and Brad Whitford on guitars, Tom Hamilton on bass, and Joey Kramer on drums. They’ve outdone the trends and fads of rock and roll to become one of the most powerful and electrifying forces in popular music.\n\nRewind for a minute to the early ‘70s, when the phrase “sex, drugs and rock & roll” was a rebellious teenager. Enter Aerosmith with a sexy swagger and thrusts ofmetal, glam and boogie woogie. Tyler’s lyrics laced with double entendres and witty humor perfectly complimented by the entire group cool urban charisma. Beyond driving rock and roll tunes, Aerosmith created quintessential power ballads such as Dream On. This dual skill set gave the band a string of gold and platinum albums, including Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic and Rocks.\n\nThe early ‘80s were rockier times, with Perry and Whitford temporarily leaving the Aero fold to pursue solo projects. The guitarists returned in 1984 and soon after, Aerosmith was back in the saddle again. And they have been on top of the charts ever since. Albums like Permanent Vacation, Pump, Get a Grip and Nine Lives, Just Push Play, and their latest release, the blues-inspired 'Honkin' on Bobo', have all been huge successes. And the killer videos – a driving force of the video medium, these Boston rockers led the look, style and attitude of the ‘80s MTV generation. Videos for Dude Looks Like a Lady, Livin’ On the Edge and Crazy (starring Liv) are solid MTV classics. And later, with videos like Pink and Jaded, Aerosmith continued to cut the edge.\n\nAlways a step ahead of the pack, Aerosmith’s Just Push Play is the first album to be produced by band members Steven Tyler and Joe Perry (along with Mark Hudson and Marti Frederiksen). The unforgettable pop melodies and bone-shaking rock riffs that are Just Push Play sent Aerosmith even further on their path to musical immortality.\n\n'Honkin' on Bobo' was released in March 2004, and as one Rolling Stone review put it: \"Aerosmith don't have much time for pain on Honkin' on Bobo. The songs are mostly about gettin' some, then gettin' outta there -- Dixon's \"I'm Ready,\" Bo Diddley's \"Road Runner\" -- and the attack is heavy Sixties shindig: snarling guitars, thunderclap drumming, Steven Tyler's 3-D snake hiss and widescreen yowl. Bobo is really a combined tribute: to the originators of the blues' core repertoire and the explosive, electric inventions of 1960s British bands such as the Yardbirds, Mayall's Bluesbreakers and the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac.\" (David Fricke, Rolling Stone)\n\nWith such an unstoppable passion for creating great music, a unique creative vision and an unyielding appreciation for their fans, there are no limits to what the future holds for Aerosmith.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150656506233124","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/305909_10150656506233124_932482965_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":10207917,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/aerosmith","location":{"street":"","city":"Boston","state":"MA","country":"United States","zip":""},"name":"Aerosmith","personal_interests":"\n\n","record_label":"Sony","talking_about_count":93804,"username":"aerosmith","website":"www.aerosmith.com\nwww.aeroforceone.com\nwww.twitter.com/aerosmith","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Lady Antebellum","id":"6611987594","info":{"id":"6611987594","about":"Songwriters, musicans, friends. http://smarturl.it/ladyantebellum","app_id":"0","band_members":"Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood","bio":"Lady Antebellum’s platinum third disc \"Own The Night\" debuted at the No. one position on Billboard’s Top 200 in Nov. and most recently earned the trophy for Best Country Album at the 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards.

Emerging from the depths of Bakersfield, California with a sound unlike any other in 1994, Korn have been able to cement themselves as one of the most important bands in rock n' roll history.\n\nOver the course of eight full-length releases, Korn have sold in excess of 30 million albums and played countless sold-out shows worldwide. They've won two Grammys—one for Best Short Form Video for \"Freak on a Leash\" from 1998’s Follow the Leader and one for Best Metal Performance for \"Here to Stay,\" from 2002’s Untouchables—and have launched a massively successful festival of their own, The Family Values Tour. However, despite all their massive success and accolades, Korn haven't lost hold of the savage, raw energy that made them such a crucial band for diehard rock and metal fans. Korn are one of the preeminent voices of this generation.\n\nTheir ninth offering, Korn III —Remember Who You Are, is their first effort for brand new label home, Roadrunner Records, and it bursts at the seams with that very feeling that defined the band from the get-go. Each song unleashes an uneasiness reminiscent of Korn's earliest and most unbridled material, but there’s also a modern refinement that's epic in its execution. Korn definitely don't lose sight of their roots on Remember Who You Are, but they also venture into uncharted darkness. All that truly matters is where they're going. The album strikes a balance between their past and their future, as it finds the band reuniting with producer Ross Robinson, who manned the boards for their first two records, all the while joining forces with Roadrunner Records, the world’s leading rock label.\n\nWith Korn III – Remember Who You Are, it's their time...\n\nKorn bleed with unsettling and unpredictable aggression on Remember Who You Are's 10 tracks. \"Oildale (Leave Me Alone)\" buzzes with an eerie clean guitar that slowly gives way to a steamrolling bass and riff assault. \"Move On\" morphs from a myriad of creaking tones into an explosive vocal freak-out that's impossible not to connect with it on a visceral level. Then there's the neck-snapping \"Fear Is A Place to Live\" tempering deadly guitar dissonance with an unforgettable chorus. This is Korn reborn.\n\n\"This album is a reflection of us being a band since 1993,\" says vocalist Jonathan Davis. \"We worked hard on the previous records, and we experimented a lot. For Remember Who You Are, the four of us got together in a small room with the intention of writing an old school Korn record. This album is a perfect mixture of everything we've done, and this version of the band is the best ever.\" It's as if Korn revisited their storied beginnings, but as a wiser, tighter and more precise outfit blessed with the benefit of experience.\n\nIn order to tap into the chaos that made their self-titled debut a modern classic, the band enlisted the help of the man who helmed Korn and Life is Peachy—producer Ross Robinson, whose goal was to bring Korn back to square one. He undoubtedly succeeded. Davis had an intense and invigorating recording session. \"Ross helped us remember what we used to do this for,\" the singer says. \"It was more psychological than anything. Ross was right there pushing me and he drove me insane. I sing about a lot of things that hit really close to my heart and he knew how to trigger that. I nearly fucking broke down at the end of almost every song, but I got it all out.\"\n\nFor guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer, the experience was no different. He elaborates, \"Teaming up with Ross has brought that raw, emotional feeling back to the music. Ross is the only person in the world that's ever been able to draw us to that place. He reminds us why we're here, why these songs are important to our fans and why what we do as a band relates. He made us remember how our music saves lives, and he came into the picture at the perfect time. We had no record label and just wanted to make a great album. Ross stepped in at the right moment to hit the reset button.\"\n\nHitting that \"reset button\" involved stripping down the process. There would be no Pro-Tools, no tracking separately and no heavy post editing. In order to conjure Remember Who You Are's claustrophobic yet wholly organic chaos, Korn recorded on two-inch tape and locked themselves inside a 10x10 room buried within their Los Angeles studio, nicknamed \"The Cat Box.\" Being in such close proximity to one another stirred up a torrent of explosive music. Bassist Reggie \"Fieldy\" Arvizu remembers, \"In that room, even if I turned my bass head, it would hit somebody. Getting back in there was like a family reunion. We felt like brothers again. Being older and setting egos aside, we were able to focus on making the best record we could.\"\n\nDavis dug deep for cuts like \"The Past\" and \"Never Around.\" About \"The Past,\" the singer says, \"A lot of people dwell on the past, and they feel guilt. There's nothing you can do about the past because it's gone and it's blown up. We're here now.\" On Korn III – Remember Who You Are, Davis is fully present and at his most vitriolic, violent and vibrant on the likes of \"Move On\" and \"Are You Ready to Live?\"\n\nHe goes on, \"I let everything flow, while I was coming up with lyrics. They're about me living my life for others when I shouldn't, people-pleasing all of the time, stress, guilt and all kinds of emotions we live with everyday that destroy us and tear us down. I write about all of the fake people around us and how I always try to fix other people's problems. I write what I feel, and it comes out naturally. I've got a lot of shit built up inside me; that doesn't go away.\"\n\nEven though Korn went back to square one, they continue to break new ground. In a career marked by innovation, they still smash boundaries. Munky even fingerpicks certain instrumental passages, while trying out new tones on echo-y soundscapes. \"The heavier I play, the more you can hear the aggression. The lighter I pick, the lighter the mood is,” he said. “I used vintage guitars, echos, long delays and reverbs. When we did the first two records, we broke the music down to a completely emotional beast. Through the years, we started to experiment with vocal harmonies and more orchestrated pieces. Recording this album, we brought that knowledge into the raw emotion of what we already knew. You hear the melodies and layers, but it still comes from a very primitive Korn.\"\n\nThat primitive Korn includes drummer Ray Luzier, who became Korn's touring drummer in late 2007 and was made an official member in 2009. On cuts like the deadly \"Fear Is A Place To Live,\" he propels the aggression. Fieldy says, \"Ray is like the missing Korn member we never had. He just fits so well. When we found him, it just clicked because his playing sounds like Korn. He plays with me, and the way that he plays is exactly what I needed. We know what we're doing on stage with each other, and everybody's on the same page. I've waited my whole career for Korn to sound like we do now.\"\n\nKorn may have changed members with Brian \"Head\" Welch and David Silveria departing in 2005 and 2006 respectively, but Jonathan, Munky, Fieldy and Ray capture the feeling that was there in the beginning.\n\nFor Davis, the album name covers it all. \"It comes down to one question: 'Who the fuck am I?' It's about remembering where we came from. The title sums up everything I'm talking about lyrically. During the first two records, we were kids, and we didn't have anything. We were making music, having fun and not worrying. I went back to that place where I wasn't worried. I wanted to be completely honest with my feelings, express myself and let them out. People get so wrapped up in social communities, the Internet and technology that they forget who they are and what life's really about. I fucking forgot who I was until I did this record. This album is just a bass, a guitar, drums and my vocals. I look at the records we've done as slots in time, and I believe Remember Who You Are is very special.\"\n\nThe album captures the band's legendary performance style that's ignited crowds worldwide on stages ranging from OZZfest and Projekt Revolution to Woodstock and Download. It's the same spirit that gave pop culture hits such as \"Blind,\" \"A.D.I.D.A.S.,\" \"Got the Life,\" \"Falling Away from Me\" and \"Twisted Transistor.\" It’s clear, however, that Korn III – Remember Who You Are is another thrilling chapter being etched into Korn’s already impressive history.\n\n\"There's that timeless space that we enter where nothing else matters on stage,\" says Munky. \"It's us, the crowd and the music. We lose track of where we are and who we are, and it's just a timeless shared space between us and the audience. We lose ourselves in the music. I want fans to lose themselves in the new music by forgetting about any problems or anything going on in their minds and let their hearts hear it. It's the same experience that I get when I'm on stage.\"\n\nThe process brought them back to the beginning, but it also encouraged serious growth. Everyone is locked in like never before. Fieldy adds, \"We want to take you on a rollercoaster with this record. There are spacey and weird parts where the bass can breathe and there are some heavy moments. On Remember Who You Are, I'm doing what I really wanted to do on our first record.\"\n\nIn the end, this is for the people that made Korn—the millions of kids worldwide that buy every record, wear every shirt and never miss a show. Davis concludes, \"I love doing what I do. I love helping kids. I love hearing fans say, 'You got me through this or that.' It makes me feel like I've done something positive. I want kids to feel what I'm saying and really hear it. I'd love for the new songs to provoke them to think about what goes on around them. We're very fortunate to keep doing what we're doing, still be relevant and create music that invokes feelings from people.\"\n\nWith music this powerful, no one will ever forget who Korn are.\n\nFor more information, contact Amy Sciarretto in the Roadrunner Records Publicity Department at amy@roadrunnerrecords.com or 212.274.7500\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151512576285761","source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/207286_10151512576285761_1255095979_n.jpg","offset_y":40,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Bakersfield, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":10853385,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/korn","name":"Korn","record_label":"Roadrunner Records","talking_about_count":92631,"username":"korn","website":"http://www.korn.com http://www.myspace.com/korn http://www.facebook.com/korn http://www.twitter.com/korn http://www.youtube.com/user/kornchannel","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Tercer Cielo","id":"96569389636","info":{"id":"96569389636","about":"SIGUENOS EN TWITTER http://twitter.com/tercercielo\nY EN INSTAGRAM www.instagram.com/tercercielooficial y\nwww.instagram.com/evelynherreraoficial","app_id":"0","band_interests":".\n-Reconocimientos de Tercer Cielo \n\nPremios BILLBOARD/Billboard Latin Music Award \n2011 Latin Pop Albums Artist of the Year, Duo or Group – Nominados\n2010 Latin Pop Albums Artist of the Year, Duo or Group – Nominados\n\nPremios Latin GRAMMY/Latin Grammy Awards \n2012 Mejor Album Cristiano (en Español) - Nominados\n2011 Mejor Álbum Cristiano (en Español) – Nominados\n\nBMI Latin Music Award\n2011 Composer/Publisher Recognition – “Mi Ultimo Día” - Ganadores\n\nPremios Lo Nuestro\n2011 Mejor Grupo o Dúo – Nominados\n\nPremios Casandra (Republica Dominicana) \n2011 Mejor Álbum – Música Religiosa Contemporánea – Ganadores \n2010 Mejor Álbum – Música Religiosa Contemporánea – Ganadores \n\nPremios ARPA\n2011 Canción del Año – “Mi Ultimo Día” – Ganadores\n2011 Mejor Álbum de Grupo o Dúo –  \n\t\t“Gente Común, Sueños Extraordinarios” – Ganadores\n\nPremios Unción FM (Costa Rica) \n2010 Mejor Álbum Genero Pop – Ganadores\n2010 Mejor Canción de Grupo “Creeré” – Ganadores\n2010 Mejor Canción del Año “Creeré” – Ganadores\n----------------------------\n\nBillboard Charts Album\n2009 - Gente Común...-Latin Pop Albums - #1\n2009 - Gente Común...-Top Latin Albums - #14\n2009 - Gente Común...-Top Christian Albums - #27\n2009 - Gente Común...-Top Christian Albums - #42\n2011 - Viaje A Las Estrellas - Latin Pop Albums - #10 \n2011 - Viaje A Las Estrellas - Top Christian Albums - #40 \n2011 - Viaje A Las Estrellas - Top Heatseekers - #33 \n2011 - Viaje A Las Estrellas - Top Latin Albums - #28\n\nBillboard Charts Singles\n2008 - Yo Te Extrañaré - Latin Pop Airplay - #27\n2009 - Creere - Latin Pop Airplay - #16\n2009 - Mi Último Dia - Latin Pop Airplay - #21\n2010 - Entre Tu Y Yo - Latin Pop Airplay - #15\n2010 - Entre Tu Y Yo - Hot Latin Songs - #46\n2010 - Exagerado Amor [Live Desde Puerto Rico / 2010] -\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLatin Pop Airplay - #31\n2011 - Tu Amor No Es De Este Mundo - Latin Pop Airplay - #25\n2011 - Tu Amor No Es De Este Mundo  - Latin Pop Airplay - #25\n\niTunes Music Charts\n2010 - iTunes Latino Chart (Finland) - Creeré - #4\n2010 - iTunes Latino Chart (Switzerland) - Creeré - #73\n2010 - iTunes Latino Chart (Germany)\t- Creeré - #91\n2010 - iTunes Latino Chart (Luxembourg) - Creeré - #92\n2010 - iTunes Latino Chart (USA) - Creeré - #117\n2010 - iTunes Latino Chart (England) - Mi Ultimo Día - #99\n2011 - iTunes Latino Chart (Australia) - Yo Te Extrañaré - #50\n2011 - iTunes Latino Chart (Netherlands) – Ese Soy Yo - #14\n2011 - iTunes Latino Chart (Japan) - Creeré -#47\n","band_members":"Evelyn Herrera, Juan Carlos Rodriguez","bio":"Tercer Cielo, es un célebre dúo de música pop con letras inspiracionales, integrado por Juan Carlos Rodríguez y Evelyn Herrera.\n\nLos inicios de Tercer Cielo comenzaron en el año 2000, cuando en República Dominicana, Juan Carlos invitó a su amigo Marcos Yaroide a grabar y compartir música con él, bajo el nombre de “Tercer Cielo”.  En ese tiempo Juan Carlos se establecía como productor y compositor, hoy en día reconocido por más de 300 canciones de su propia autoria.  Marcos decidió dejar Tercer Cielo, en el 2005, para continuar con su carrera musical como solista. \n\nJuan Carlos conoció a la bella interprete méxico-americana, Evelyn (Herrera) cuando fue invitado a producir un proyecto musical de ella. Tiempo después se volvieron a ver y después de una larga amistad, contrajeron matrimonio en el año 2006.  Evelyn dejó su carrera como solista para formar parte de Tercer Cielo en el año 2007. \n\nA lo largo de su trayectoria Tercer Cielo ha grabado 9 producciones, y ha vendido más de 1.5 millones copias de manera independiente.  Entre ellas resaltan: “Llueve”, “Hollywood”, “Gente Común, Sueños Extraordinarios”, “Viaje a Las Estrellas” y su más reciente álbum discográfico, “Lo Que El Viento Me Enseñó”. \n\nDe sus álbumes se han desprendido múltiples éxitos radiales, tales como: \"Yo Te Extrañaré\", \"Héroe\", \"Cada Día\" y “Mí Último Día”, entre otros temas. Las letras de Tercer Cielo se enfocan en temas positivos, y espirituales, con mensajes de fe, amor, y esperanza dirigidas a jóvenes que buscan tocar el mundo con el amor de dios.  \n\nEl dúo con raíces dominicanas y mexicanas, también fue nominado por dos años consecutivos a los Premios Billboard (2010 & 2011) junto a grupos como: Camila, Maná, Reik, Hillsongs, y La Quinta Estación,  en la categoría Latín Pop Albums, Artista del Año, Dúo o Grupo.  El éxito “Creeré” fue entonado en vivo durante el telecast de los Premios Billboard 2010®, por Tercer Cielo junto a Ricardo Montaner y Milly Quezada.\n\nEn el año 2011 el dúo fue nominado al Latin Grammy ®, Premios Lo Nuestro®, y reconocidos con el Premio Arpa® y el 2011 BMI Latin Music Award® por el éxito “Mí Último Día”, canción compuesta por Juan Carlos (Fe y Obra Music/Mucho Fruto Publishing) e interpretada por Tercer Cielo. \n\nA lo largo de una carrera incansable, Tercer Cielo ha visitado (en giras), a más de 200 ciudades del mundo en Norte, Centro, y Sur America, El Caribe, y Europa, presentándose ante miles de personas. Actualmente Tercer Cielo se encuentra en la gira mundial de su más reciente producción “Lo Que El Viento Me Enseñó ”.  \n\nEl impacto de Tercer Cielo se ha extendido a las redes sociales, cuando en el mes de noviembre de 2011 sobrepasaron los 3 millones de fans en la popular red social, Facebook.\n\nTercer Cielo también se ha dado a conocer por su infinito y desinteresado apoyo a fundaciones sin ánimo de lucro, donde han donado su tiempo y colaborado con recursos, para promover cambios y nuevos horizontes en el mundo.\n\n(por Henry Alonzo/Adarga Ent. Group)\n--------------------------\n\nTercer Cielo (Third Heaven) is a celebrated Latin Pop/Inspirational music duo, comprised of husband and wife team, Juan Carlos Rodriguez and Evelyn Herrera.\n\nTercer Cielo began in the year 2000 in the Dominican Republic when Juan Carlos invited his friend, Marcos Yaroide to record music with him under the name “Tercer Cielo.”  At that time, Juan Carlos was an established producer and composer; currently he has composed over 300 original songs. Marcos was a member of Tercer Cielo until 2005, at which time he launched his career as a solo artist.\n\nJuan Carlos met the beautiful Mexican-American singer, Evelyn (Herrera) when he was invited to produce one of her musical projects.  Some time later, they met up again and continued to see each other, and after a long friendship, were married in 2006.  Evelyn left her career as a soloist in order to become part of Tercer Cielo in 2007.\n\nTercer Cielo has recorded 9 projects and has independently sold over 1.5 million albums.  Included among these are: “Llueve” (Rain), “Hollywood,” “Gente Común, Sueños Extraordinarios” (Common People, Extraordinary Dreams), “Viaje a Las Estrellas” (Journey to the Stars), and their most recent album, “Lo Que El Viento Me Enseñó” (What I Learned From The Wind).\n\nMultiple radio hits have resulted from these albums, including: “Yo Te Extrañaré” (I will miss you), “Héroe” (Hero), “Cada Día” (Every day), and “Mí Último Día” (My last day).  Tercer Cielo’s lyrics focus on positive and spiritual themes, with messages of faith, love, and hope, directed towards those who seek to touch the world.\n\nAdditionally, for two consecutive years, the duet has been nominated to the Billboard Latin Music Awards (2010 and 2011), along international artists such as: Camila, Maná, Reik, Hillsongs, and La Quinta Estacion, in the category of “Latin Pop Albums; Artist of the Year, Duet or Group”.  Their popular radio-hit, “Creere” (I Believe), was performed live during a telecast of the Billboards in 2010, by Tercer Cielo with Ricardo Montaner and Milly Quezada.\n\nDuring 2011, the duet was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award, as well as Premios Lo Nuestro (commonly known as the: Latin People’s Choice Awards), and won the Premio Arpa (Harp Award) and the 2011 BMI Latin Music Award for their hit, “Mí Último Día,” composed by Juan Carlos (Fe y Obra Music/Mucho Fruto Publishing) and performed by Tercer Cielo.\n\nTercer Cielo has toured to more than 200 cities playing to sold-out audiences within North, Central and South America, as well as Europe and the Caribbean.  Currently, Tercer Cielo is in their world tour titled, “Lo Que El Viento Me Enseñó” (What I Learned From The Wind).\n\nIn November of 2011, Tercer Cielo’s impact extended to social networks, when they surpassed more than 3 million fans on Facebook.\n\nTercer Cielo is also known for their support to non-profit organizations where they have donated their time and resources, in an attempt to bring light to the charitable deeds of various organizations.\n\n(by Henry Alonzo/Adarga Ent.

If ever the world needed to feel good again, that time is ... Here and Now.\n\nTraversing the sonic spectrum with a pulsating energy and enthusiasm reflected in the musical diversity, Here and Now is the much-loved Nickelback experience propelled to new levels as the band continues to lure listeners into their trademark party brew of fast-lane indulgences; some tunes tamed by somber reflection while others wickedly embraced with a devilish wink and a smile. With almost 45 million sold worldwide, music fans remain thirsty for the vicarious thrills of Nickelback's newest intoxicating elixir.\n\n\"I think we're very lucky because from the beginning, we never painted ourselves into a corner of saying we're only going to make one kind of music,\" explains Chad Kroeger, during the final days of recording Here and Now at his Mountain View Studios outside Vancouver. \"As a result, we're kind of all over the map with the songs that get accepted by our fans. And that's fantastic, because that means there's always going to be a ton of diversity on all our records.\"\n\nIt's a conviction shared by Ryan Peake, who recounts the band's early days of bucking trends as key to Nickelback's longevity. \"When you fashion yourself after musical fads, you'll find out you're yesterday's news in a couple years. Suddenly, you wake up one day and find out you've completely pigeon-holed yourself. But when you're honest in what you do and concentrate on the songwriting, people will follow you. Fortunately, we have such a well-rounded fan base. And in these days of extreme ups and downs and cyclical musical movements, our fans have always stuck by us.”\n\n\"Because at the end of the day,\" adds Peake, \"people just really like hearing good songs, plain and simple. They like to feel good; whether they're singing along or just listening to it. It's something innate in all of us.\"\n\nSo what better way to uncork  Here and Now than a double-shot of kickoff singles that toasts the band's enduring potency: \"Bottoms Up,\" a blazing paean to unlimited libations crafted with unmistakable Nickelback hooks and epic chorus, fueled even further by Peake's blistering guitar, Daniel Adair's thunderous drumming and Kroeger's gritty and commanding vocals as the song's raucous ringleader. Guaranteed to become a party staple, \"Bottoms Up\" will assuredly earn a place in the pantheon of fist-pumping rock classics.  Serving as an equally vibrant mixer is Nickelback's other lead single \"When We Stand Together,\" a decidedly up-tempo anthem that underscores the social conscience still beating in the hearts of those small-town boys from Hanna, Alberta. The highly melodic, foot-stomping anthem belies the more serious underpinnings of lyrics challenging societal apathy as Kroeger sings: \"One more depending on a prayer / And we all look away / People pretending everywhere / It's just another day / There's bullets flying through the air / And they still carry on / We watch it happen over there / And then just turn it off.\"\n\nIt's a recurring theme that surfaces over the many Nickelback albums - from previous hits like \"If Everyone Cared\" to \"If Today Was Your Last Day\" - that Kroeger sees as a way of raising public consciousness, even if in small doses. Not one to commandeer a soapbox, Kroeger is earnest when he explains the genesis of \"When We Stand Together\" that \"we can bring awareness to the fact that we can make the world a better place if we actually just stood together and acted as one world, instead of acting as so many different countries with their own agendas.\"\n\n\"It's just so easy for us to see things unfold on TV and then just change the channel,\" Kroeger continues. \"I wanted to draw attention to a couple things in a general sense that might hopefully resonate. And regardless of how 'pop' sounding it may be, I felt the lyrics of  'When We Stand Together' just carried such weight that I needed to offset it with a lighter musical sound. And I think it turned into this really cool balance.\"\n\nIndeed. Both singles are making a huge impact on the rock and pop charts - further testament to Nickelback's wide appeal in an increasingly fractured music scene. But Nickelback has always defied conventional norms; they've pushed boundaries and marched to the beat of their own drum. Call it wisdom or stubbornness, but the band's tenacity has paid off in droves. Billboard magazine named Nickelback \"Group of the Decade\" and their 2001 breakthrough hit \"How You Remind Me\" as \"Top Rock Song\" of the decade. They've achieved a remarkable five Grammy Award nominations, three American Music Awards, a World Music Award, a People's Choice Award, and 12 Juno Awards. Their 2005 album All The Right Reasons  remained in the Billboard Top 30 for over two years, was certified 8-times platinum in the U.S. and sold a staggering 11 million copies worldwide, spawning five Top 20 singles \"Savin' Me,” \"Rockstar,\" \"Photograph,”  “Fall Away” and “If Everyone Cared.”\n\nNickelback's phenomenal success quickly attracted the attention of veteran producer Mutt Lange, famed hit-maker, who signed on as producer of 2008's Dark Horse. The band's aptly-titled album showcased their unwavering resolve, approaching almost eight million digital single sales of hits like \"Gotta Be Somebody,\" \"Burn It To The Ground,” \"If Today Was Your Last Day,\" and \"This Afternoon” plus more than 61 million video plays over the course of the album's campaign. Dark Horse also fueled a record-breaking two year world tour for Nickelback, who so far have played to well over five million fans across the globe. With 15 radio hits charting at #1 since 2000, Nickelback has earned the unique distinction of being the second best-selling foreign act in America - right beside the Beatles.\n\nNot bad for a group of guys who as teens simply dreamed of one day performing \"to more than just the steering wheel” as Kroeger so famously sang in his nostalgic confessional \"Photograph.”  \"Geez, I remember playing every night in a cover band in these small clubs and maybe making $300 a week and thinking to myself, 'This is so awesome! What am I going to do with all this money?'\" chuckles Kroeger, reflecting on his humble beginnings as a musician. His brother, bassist Mike Kroeger, remembers those early days well. \"We would always think, 'God, wouldn't it be cool to play our songs for someone other than just our roommates or family - somewhere where people actually showed up to watch music?' But believe me, none of us as kids were learning how to play the pentatonic scale going, 'Yup, Wembley Arena here we come!\" says Kroeger with a huge laugh.\n\n\"It really wasn't until we got a record deal and then once Silver Side Up did what it did that all of a sudden we were like, 'Okay, we need to start behaving like a world class act and we've got to put together a show that can really entertain people in an arena,’\" adds Chad Kroeger, who likens himself to the Master of Ceremonies of a wild private party for over 20,000 of his closest friends every night. \"When I'm on stage, I'm definitely in über party mode. I mean, we put on this huge rock and roll show entertaining people, but everyone always says it goes beyond that - it's like this enormous celebration where all these Nickelback fans can get together and really let loose.\"\n\nWhich brings us full circle to Here and Now, the band's seventh album and quite possibly their most creatively liberating. \"The dynamic in the studio was much more fun again,\" notes Adair. \"This time I felt like, 'Okay, it's just the four of us again, we're self-produced, lets just do our thing.' And it flowed extremely well.” \n\n\"I mean, we actually had weekends off, which we didn't on the Dark Horse sessions,\" continues Adair. \"When you're working 14 hour days, 64 days straight, it's just not healthy. It's actually counter-productive. Because in the big picture, you can actually get more accomplished in the same amount of time with a more normal schedule.\"\n\nAs the band convened from April through early October, Here and Now's 11 tracks grew organically, according to Peake. \"It wasn't calculated at all,\" he says. \"That's why this album is really across the board - from heavy rock and pop-sounding songs, to lighter, more middle-of-the-road songs. We brought a lot of ideas to the table and sussed them out until we were all happy.\" \n\nThe challenge, admits Mike Kroeger, \"is that the more records we make, the more we feel like we have to dig deeper and do stuff that we haven't done yet, but also expand and go even further on the type of songs our fans love. There's a lot of  'No, that's not good enough' and we’ve gotta tear it all down and start again or completely re-tool.”\n\n\"Because we know very consciously what we've done in the past and where the bar has been set,\" adds Kroeger, \"and you can phone it in - that's very easy to do - but our fans will know that immediately. So every time we go into the studio, it's about making our fans happy and hearing them say that it's not only a record they love, but that it's a Nickelback record that they love amongst all the other Nickelback records. That's what we strive for every single time.\"\n\nNickelback strikes all the right chords as they once again prove their uncanny knack for crafting catchy songs with unforgettable hooks and indelible lyrical wordplay. Whether it's melodic ballads like \"Lullaby,” \"Trying Not To Love You\" and \"Don't Ever Let It End\" (an acoustic gem about lovers caught in the “friend zone” that Chad Kroeger calls \"very special\"), to the metallic roar of \"This Means War\" and the reckless abandon of grinding rockers like \"Gotta Get Me Some\" and \"Midnight Queen,” the band undeniably has hit a home run with Here and Now.\n\n\"So as long as people want to hear us play, then we'll just keep going,\" Kroeger states. \"And until that day comes, this is the absolute best gig in the world and we'll just keep rolling with the punches.\" \n\nBottoms Up!","booking_agent":"The Agency Group","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151544859657086","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/297907_10151544859657086_1699435282_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"general_manager":"Union Entertainment Group, Inc.","genre":"Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Vancouver, Canada","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":16466837,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Nickelback","name":"Nickelback","press_contact":"publicity@roadrunnerrecords.com","record_label":"Roadrunner Records","talking_about_count":89532,"username":"Nickelback","website":"http://www.nickelback.com http://www.twitter.com/nickelback http://www.youtube.com/nickelback ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Jay Sean","id":"102451659813253","info":{"id":"102451659813253","about":"www.jaysean.com      www.twitter.com/jaysean      http://merchdirect.com/jaysean       Instagram:Jaysheezy","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":507742209284194,"source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/13928_507742209284194_749913310_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"New York, NY","general_manager":"Jeremy Skaller and Thara Prashad","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":5477615,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/jaysean","name":"Jay Sean","record_label":"Cash Money Records","talking_about_count":89503,"username":"jaysean","website":"www.JaySean.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Amy Winehouse","id":"7310480740","info":{"id":"7310480740","about":"The official Amy Winehouse Facebook page http://www.amywinehouse.com/","app_id":"0","band_members":"Amy Winehouse","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150603515675741","source":"http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/479783_10150603515675741_1381846124_n.jpg","offset_y":19,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Rock/pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"London","influences":"Sarah Vaughn\nDinah Washington\nMos Def\nShangri Las\nBusta Rhymes\nThe Specials\nNas\nElvis Presley\n","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8640292,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/amywinehouse","name":"Amy Winehouse","record_label":"Island Records","talking_about_count":89342,"username":"amywinehouse","website":"www.amywinehouse.com www.myspace.com/amywinehouse","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Atif Aslam Official Page || AADEEZ","id":"182973122142","info":{"id":"182973122142","about":"Welcome To The \" Atif Aslam Official Page \" On Facebook            \nFollow me on Twitter: www.twitter.com/itsaadee","app_id":"0","bio":"Atif Aslam is the biggest superstar in the history of Pakistan.

Céline has been called the premier contemporary pop vocalist of the Nineties. She has earned music industry accolades from around the world: Grammy Awards in the US, Juno and Felix Awards in Canada, and World Music Awards in Europe. The entire world has seen Céline Dion literally transform herself from a gifted pre-adolescent into an international superstar.\n\nBorn in Charlemagne (a small town 30 miles east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada), Céline is the youngest of 14 children of a highly musical family. Her parents, both musicians, operated a small club, and on weekends, the entire family performed and entertained the local population. From the tender age of 5, Céline sang with her siblings and quickly acquired the ability to perform live. At the age of twelve, together with her mother and one of her brothers, Céline composed a French song which would forever alter the course of her life.\n\nThe demo tape containing the song was brought to the attention of René Angélil, a well respected personal manager. In January 1981, René was so taken by the voice of the young Céline, that he became determined to make her an internationally known talent - he even mortgaged his house to finance the recording of Céline's debut album!\n\nCéline began to receive recognition for her talent in 1982, winning the Gold Medal at the Yamaha World Song Festival in Tokyo, along with the coveted Musician's Award for Top Performer. In 1983, she became the first Canadian ever to receive a Gold Record in France. \n\nBy 1988, Céline had established a strong name for herself in her native province of Quebec, where she was enjoying superstar status, receiving numerous Felix Awards and racking up platinum albums. That same year, Céline won the prestigious Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin Ireland, where she performed live before a television audience of 600 million viewers throughout Europe, the USSR, the Middle-East, Japan, and Australia.\n\nIn September, 1990 Céline released 'Unison' - her first English-language album and her first for Sony Music - and scored a breakthrough US hit with the Top 5 single \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\".\n\nCéline's international breakthrough came when she recorded the title track for the soundtrack to the animated Disney hit movie 'Beauty and the Beast.' The song went to number one and garnered an Academy Award and a Grammy Award. \"Beauty and the Beast\" formed the cornerstone for Céline's second English language album, called simply 'Céline Dion.' That album produced four more hit singles including \"Love Can Move Mountains,\" \"Water From The Moon,\" \"If You Asked Me To\" and \"Did You Give Enough Love.\" In Canada, the album went six times platinum and set the stage for an incredible streak of Juno Awards.\n\nOn December 17, 1994, Céline Dion and René Angélil were married at Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151045789311651","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/430492_10151045789311651_438176229_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Charlemagne, Quebec, Canada","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":10585765,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/celinedion","name":"Celine Dion","record_label":"Columbia Records","talking_about_count":85167,"username":"celinedion","website":"http://www.celinedion.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"John Lennon","id":"135388936479828","info":{"id":"135388936479828","about":"The official Facebook page for John Lennon friends and fans.

Hendrix's innovative style of combining fuzz, feedback and controlled distortion created a new musical form. Because he was unable to read or write music, it is nothing short of remarkable that Jimi Hendrix's meteoric rise in the music took place in just four short years. His musical language continues to influence a host of modern musicians, from George Clinton to Miles Davis, and Steve Vai to Jonny Lang.\n\nJimi Hendrix, born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942, at Seattle's King County Hospital, was later renamed James Marshall by his father, James \"Al\" Hendrix. Young Jimmy (as he was referred to at the time) took an interest in music, drawing influence from virtually every major artist at the time, including B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Holly, and Robert Johnson. Entirely self-taught, Jimmy's inability to read music made him concentrate even harder on the music he heard.\n\nAl took notice of Jimmy's interest in the guitar, recalling, \"I used to have Jimmy clean up the bedroom all the time while I was gone, and when I would come home I would find a lot of broom straws around the foot of the bed. I'd say to him, `Well didn't you sweep up the floor?' and he'd say, `Oh yeah,' he did. But I'd find out later that he used to be sitting at the end of the bed there and strumming the broom like he was playing a guitar.\" Al found an old one-string ukulele, which he gave to Jimmy to play a huge improvement over the broom.\n\nBy the summer of 1958, Al had purchased Jimmy a five-dollar, second-hand acoustic guitar from one of his friends. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy joined his first band, The Velvetones. After a three-month stint with the group, Jimmy left to pursue his own interests. The following summer, Al purchased Jimmy his first electric guitar, a Supro Ozark 1560S; Jimi used it when he joined The Rocking Kings.\n\nIn 1961, Jimmy left home to enlist in the United States Army and in November 1962 earned the right to wear the \"Screaming Eagles\" patch for the paratroop division. While stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimmy formed The King Casuals with bassist Billy Cox. After being discharged due to an injury he received during a parachute jump, Jimmy began working as a session guitarist under the name Jimmy James. By the end of 1965, Jimmy had played with several marquee acts, including Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, the Isley Brothers, and Little Richard. Jimmy parted ways with Little Richard to form his own band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, shedding the role of back-line guitarist for the spotlight of lead guitar.\n\nThroughout the latter half of 1965, and into the first part of 1966, Jimmy played the rounds of smaller venues throughout Greenwich Village, catching up with Animals' bassist Chas Chandler during a July performance at Caf� Wha? Chandler was impressed with Jimmy's performance and returned again in September 1966 to sign Hendrix to an agreement that would have him move to London to form a new band.\n\nSwitching gears from bass player to manager, Chandler's first task was to change Hendrix's name to \"Jimi.\" Featuring drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, the newly formed Jimi Hendrix Experience quickly became the talk of London in the fall of 1966.\n\nThe Experience's first single, \"Hey Joe,\" spent ten weeks on the UK charts, topping out at spot No. 6 in early 1967. The debut single was quickly followed by the release of a full-length album Are You Experienced, a psychedelic musical compilation featuring anthems of a generation. Are You Experienced has remained one of the most popular rock albums of all time, featuring tracks like \"Purple Haze,\" \"The Wind Cries Mary,\" \"Foxey Lady,\" \"Fire,\" and \"Are You Experienced?\"\n\nAlthough Hendrix experienced overwhelming success in Britain, it wasn't until he returned to America in June 1967 that he ignited the crowd at the Monterey International Pop Festival with his incendiary performance of \"Wild Thing.\" Literally overnight, The Jimi Hendrix Experience became one of most popular and highest grossing touring acts in the world.\n\nHendrix followed Are You Experienced with Axis: Bold As Love. By 1968, Hendrix had taken greater control over the direction of his music; he spent considerable time working the consoles in the studio, with each turn of a knob or flick of the switch bringing clarity to his vision.\n\nBack in America, Jimi Hendrix built his own recording studio, Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The name of this project became the basis for his most demanding musical release, a two LP collection, Electric Ladyland. Throughout 1968, the demands of touring and studio work took its toll on the group and in 1969 the Experience disbanded.\n\nThe summer of 1969 brought emotional and musical growth to Jimi Hendrix. In playing the Woodstock Music & Art Fair in August 1969, Jimi joined forces with an eclectic ensemble called Gypsy Sun & Rainbows featuring Jimi Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Juma Sultan, and Jerry Velez. The Woodstock performance was highlighted by the renegade version of \"Star Spangled Banner,\" which brought the mud-soaked audience to a frenzy.\n\nNineteen sixty-nine also brought about a new and defining collaboration featuring Jimi Hendrix on guitar, bassist Billy Cox and Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles. Performing as the Band of Gypsys, this trio launched a series of four New Year's performances on December 31, 1969 and January 1, 1970. Highlights from these performances were compiled and later released on the quintessential Band of Gypsys album in mid-1970 and the expanded Hendrix: Live At The Fillmore East in 1999.\n\nAs 1970 progressed, Jimi brought back drummer Mitch Mitchell to the group and together with Billy Cox on bass, this new trio once again formed The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In the studio, the group recorded several tracks for another two LP set, tentatively titled First Rays Of The New Rising Sun. Unfortunately, Hendrix was unable to see this musical vision through to completion due to his hectic worldwide touring schedules, then tragic death on September 18, 1970. Fortunately, the recordings Hendrix slated for release on the album were finally issued through the support of his family and original studio engineer Eddie Kramer on the 1997 release First Rays Of The New Rising Sun.\n\nFrom demo recordings to finished masters, Jimi Hendrix generated an amazing collection of songs over the course of his short career. The music of Jimi Hendrix embraced the influences of blues, ballads, rock, R&B, and jazz a collection of styles that continue to make Hendrix one of the most popular figures in the history of rock music.\n\n# # # ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151319910536088","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/644366_10151319910536088_2030381705_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Rock","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4924495,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/TheJimiHendrixExperience","name":"The Jimi Hendrix Experience Official Page","talking_about_count":78444,"username":"TheJimiHendrixExperience","website":"http://www.jimihendrix.com http://www.authentichendrix.com http://www.experiencehendrixtour.com http://www.twitter.com/jimihendrix http://www.legacyrecordings.com/artists/jimi-hendrix http://www.youtube.com/jimihendrix http://www.myspace.com/officialjimihendrix ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Sorriso Maroto","id":"165449760163844","info":{"id":"165449760163844","about":"Perfil Oficial do Sorriso Maroto administrado pelos próprios artistas e sua Equipe de Produção.","app_id":"0","band_members":"Bruno Cardoso - Voz\nSergio Jr. - Violão\nCris Oliveira - Pandeiro\nFred Araújo - Surdo\nVinícius Silva - Teclados","bio":"Sorriso Maroto é um grupo de pagode originário do Rio de Janeiro.

Ever since, his unrivaled lyrical prowess, dynamic performances and timeless hits including “Stand Up,” “Get Back,”, “Number One Spot,” “Money Maker,” and “My Chick Bad,” have solidified him as one of music’s best entertainers and led to the sale of more than 20 million albums domestically.  W\nith the 2013 release of LUDAVERSAL, fans can look forward to more great music from Ludacris.  \nIn addition to immense commercial success, Ludacris' consistent output of stellar music has garnered the admiration of his peers, as well as numerous awards and honors including three Grammys. \n\nThe same talent and versatility that Ludacris showcases in his music has enabled him to make a seamless and successful transition to acting, with acclaimed performances in films including Crash, Hustle & Flow and the #1 movie, No Strings Attached in January 2011, and television’s Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, under his belt.  His work in Crash earned him the prestigious Screen Actors Guild and Critics’ Choice awards.  He co-starred in The Fast & The Furious film series, Fast Five, which debuted at #1 in April 2011 and    in May 2013, he will co-star in the latest installment of the series, Fast Six.\n\nIn addition to his non-stop efforts in the studio, on stage and on the big and small screens, Ludacris’ long held entrepreneurial spirit led him to open a restaurant, Straits, in Atlanta, GA in 2008 which he closed after 2 years in business to concentrate on the opening of his new restaurant, Chicken n Beer, which opens in Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, Concourse D in 2013.  Along with launching his own spirit, Conjure Cognac in 2009, Ludacris also entered into a partnership to launch SOUL by Ludacris headphones, which entered into the market in the summer of 2011.  Both of these ventures have captured the attention and affection of the public and firmly established themselves in their respective markets in a short time. \n\nAlthough one could wonder how Ludacris finds the time for anything outside of work, his artistic and business fortitude is only rivaled by his desire to give back and use his success to change the lives of others.  This passion inspired him to establish the Ludacris Foundation, a non-profit organization which seeks to inspire youth through education and memorable experiences to live their dreams by uplifting families, communities and fostering economic development. \n\nIn 2010, MSNBC.com named Ludacris, along with other eminent figures such as Oprah Winfrey and Warren Buffet, as one of today’s most effective influencers on American culture.  With his feet firmly planted in so many diverse areas, we can certainly see why.

Its first record in five years and its first record in fifteen years with the original band line-up, Christ Illusion is a cacophony of brutality. A soundtrack for the post-Apocalypse. Steeped in scorching riffs and a litany of menacing tracks/tirades on religion and violence, Slayer forges ahead on its devastating path of aural destruction with ten new songs, each charged with the electric hostility for which Slayer is renowned.\nOf the record Kerry King is ecstatic: \"I love it. I really like God Hates Us All and I think that's the best record we've done in my opinion since Seasons In The Abyss, and I like this better than that one. I think it's a more complete record, I think sonically it better: all the performances are awesome. I think this one is more intense not because we're trying to do 'Reign In Blood: The Sequel,' it's just that's where our writing is taking us now.\"\nSongs like the \"Flesh Storm,\" \"Eyes of the Insane,\" \"Skeleton Christ,\" \"Jihad\" and the first single, \"Cult\" showcase the band at its most blazing intensity. The sonic excitement of speed, propelled by King, Hanneman and Lombardo and lead by the immutable roar of Tom Araya provoke the listener with Slayer's trademark fascination with terror, violence and religion.\nFor as long as Slayer has been making records it has been surrounded by controversy.\nSince the band recorded its first album, \"Show No Mercy,\" Slayer has been plagued with accusations of Satanism, fascism, racism and so on. Christ Illusion gives no quarter to critics who would mindlessly attack the band for, what the Germans call, \"der Reiz des Unbekannten\" (meaning \"the attraction of the unknown\"). A lyric fascination with violence and terror which guitarist King enthusiastically describes this way: \"When I was I kid I would see a horror movie over a love story. Being shocked, being in an environment that's not reality might be frightening but is cool nonetheless. With a lot of our songs we put people in that place. It doesn't bother me because I enjoy it. It could easily be programming from all the fucking news channels.\"\nSlayer is often assailed for its subject matter, though the band is unrepentant. \" According to Araya, \"Violence, darkness... So much of my inspiration comes from news articles or pictures and just start describing the images. Television- A&E, the History Channel, Court TV, Documentaries.\"\nThe singer continues, \"With this record, as far as a theme: there is none. That's just our favorite subject matter. The common thread is death. I think that's just a common thread in general: we all share death, and we all share it at different times in different ways, but it's the one thing that we all have in common. We all die. It's how we live that makes us different.\"\nBeyond being controversial Slayer is an exceptional force in music, highly praised for its trailblazing style of fast, heavy and aggressive music yet bristling with melody. The much-heralded return of Dave Lombardo to the drummer's throne will leave fans gasping for breath as he clobbers the listener on song after song.\nCommenting on Lombardo's return to the fold, King notes, \"Not to say the shine's worn off, but it's old news to us. I think the thing the kids are going to get into, besides just being the first Slayer album in five years, is that Dave's on it. When he came back he wasn't a member, he just came back to do a couple of tours and people started asking back then 'Is he gonna hang around?' And I would tell them that was up to Dave. But I could tell that Dave was having a killer time.\" King confided. \"So it was just a matter of time before he said, 'Yeah, let's do it!' But it's great. And now that he's got a new Slayer album that he's played on, I think he's going to get some more enjoyment out of playing. He takes pride in everything he does and it's awesome to have him back with us.\"\nHaving the original members record their first album together in fifteen years is certainly newsworthy but the lasting might of the band and its continued popularity is an achievement few can boast. For each of the members, the band is resolute. There is no other band like Slayer.\n\"The staying power behind Slayer is that we've stuck to our guns,\" Says Araya. \"Integrity... that would be number one. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we've stuck to what we do best. And the fact that we've been together as a band for so long. Ten years with Dave; another ten without Dave; and now Dave's back. It has a lot to do with compromise, that's just the way it has to be. You have to be able to compromise and give and take and that has a lot to do with why we're still together and a force to be reckoned with. I've learned that without each other, Slayer wouldn't exist, and that the whole is greater than its parts.\"\nKerry King is far more succinct. \"Slayer to me is the coolest band on the planet. There is a timeless quality to Slayer. It's cool, but I can't explain it. It's our life.\"\nSlayer has created one mesmerizing record after the next, has influenced many of today's most successful bands, including Slipknot, Sepultura, Killswitch Engage, and continues to earn new generations of fans, while staying true to its ceaselessly devoted followers. Slayer's legacy is cemented in music forever and the band remains undaunted in its directive to make punishing, aggressive and exciting music. With Christ Illusion the band marks its territory. Slayer has exceeded itself far beyond thrash metal to become an unstoppable juggernaut without equal.\nTom Araya sums it up: \"I think the best thing is the band's longevity and the fact that we haven't bowed to anyone. That we were able to make a record like Reign In Blood, which, to us, was just another record, but to others, was something very special, it's had such an impact. People will remember it for a long time, and it's all because we did things our way, we didn't bow down to anyone. We didn't compromise.

His father was the chairman of Marine Construction & Shipbuilding. He played a great role to igniting the early sparks of musical inspiration towards Diab's early stages in his professional music career. Amr at the age of six sang at the July 23rd Festival in Port Said, he was surprisingly rewarded with a guitar from the governor for his excellence.\n\nAmr Diab had earned his bachelor degree in Arabic Music and graduated at the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986.\n\n\nProfessionally, Amr Diab entered the musical arena and introduced his first album \"Ya Taree'\" (1983), integrated with the audience and gained lots of attention and success. Amr followed on producing several great albums: \"Ghanny Men Albak\" (1984), \"Hala Hala\" (1986), \"Khalseen\" (1987), \"Mayyal\" (1988), \"Shawa'na\" (1989) and \"Matkhafesh\" (1990).\n\nAmr was chosen to perform and represent Egypt at the 5th Tournament of African Sports in 1990 where he sang in English, French and predominantly Arabic.

Now signed to Virgin Records and powered by a suitably smooth soul vocal from Pharrell Williams, the roar of approval for ‘One’ is so loud that it’s as if they’ve just stepped out onto the stage at Wembley. What’s more, it’s a tune so immense that they have no choice but to play it again at the end of the night. Zane Lowe, Pete Tong, Erick Morillo – it seems there isn’t anyone in the electronic scene who hasn’t been knocked out by the power of ‘One’. \n\n “The whole season has been absolutely unbelievable,” say house Mafioso Steve Angello, who’s never backwards in coming forwards with sound bites. “We’re competing with the biggest nights on the island and now we’re one of the biggest – I’ve never seen Pacha like that before. This year everybody came through and it’s been an incredible experience.” \nAs for the party, we can’t help but notice that this Motel is full of the same raw energy you’d normally see at a rock show – only for these clubbers, ‘One’ really is the new ’Teen Spirit’. “We did the track in LA together,” explains Sebastian Ingrosso. “We actually thought we wouldn’t do a track together but after ‘Leave The World Behind’ with Laidback Luke did so well, we decided to make a track and it came out great.” Amazingly, the whole shape of ‘One’ came together in just two days. Not bad for a record that Beatport has proclaimed the fastest-selling number one download single of all time. “Two days!” laughs Seb. “We had the idea and arrangement done and after that we were bouncing it back and forth for one day. The concept was simple: we had an idea of looping a kick-drum into a bassline but I said it needed a crescendo of in your face melodies.” But let’s rewind a little. We all know that ‘One’ is the record that’s flipped the script but there are so many other questions we need to be answered.\n\nFor example, how did these Swedes meet? Who gave them their name? And are they really direct descendants of the mafia?  “Me and Seb met when we were six or seven: we got into all kinds of trouble together!” laughs Steve. “Seb’s Dad had a label called Plumphouse and we got into music and did all kinds of weird things including lounge compilations and made music for shows. I even did music for a Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden…” So Team Angello and Ingrosso had been working together for quite some time. “We bumped into Axwell ten years ago now, when he was doing stuff on [the house label] Sulphuric,” says Steve. “We got in touch – we were younger than him – and we just clicked.  We all learned from each other because we were young kids. Also, when it came to the music, Me and Seb were more rough. I don’t tweak a hi-hat for six hours!” And then there was fellow Swede Eric Prydz, who together with Steve created the CR2 smash ‘Woz Not Woz in 2004. “We all hung out like friends and started building a relationship. But no-one would give us shows – we had to beg nightclubs to put us on! We begged them to let us play for one hour and everyone loved it. But since no one would touch us, that’s why we worked so hard at the start. After that, me and Ax did Supermode (the Communards-sampling ‘Tell Me Why’ on Data) and me and Seb did a couple of records as Buy Now. We never got the support – until now.”\nThe dynamic of the three and their collective history is the key to the Mafia’s continued success. “It’s been one hell of a ride,” nods Steve. “When the name ‘Swedish House Mafia’ first popped up, it wasn’t something we focused on straight away. People called us that on forums back in the day. But we’ve been through everything together. I can always lean on one of their shoulders and they can lean on mine. I can always trust their opinions. when I have a track, they tell me straight away what they think. With Swedish House Mafia, you’re with friends….” \n\nEverybody knows that Axwell, Steve and Sebastian are separate entities: they all have their own record labels (Axtone, SIZE and Refune respectively) and they all have separate lives and individual concerns. But as the success of their recent sell-out Brixton Academy shows and the growing success of Masquerade Motel will testify, it’s what they achieve collectively and as a unit that makes for the most magic. Axwell has already been giving this subject some thought. “Swedish House Mafia is a monster of its own. We’ve tried to control it and seen it as a bonus but the truth is, it just won’t go away. I call it ‘IT’! When we work together, shit happens. It’s a machine that has a certain electricity that’s much stronger than anyone else. Let’s see where it takes us.” Last summer, the Swedes weren’t together as often as they’d hoped but the demand and collective success has dictated that the Mafia must now meet almost every single week. “This Summer ‘IT’ will be more often than last Summer because we are having such an amazing time. Last year we all lived in Ibiza and we got to hang out quite a bit. But now Steve and I have kids, it will be structured hanging out time.” Ingrosso looks at the three of them as bringing different elements to the house music table: “Steve has his underground beats, Axwell is more melodic and I’m more somewhere in between,” he reasons. \n\nAs Axwell points out, one thing has changed since The Early Days: Steve and Ax are now proud parents while Sebastian is left holding the proverbial baby and keeping an eye on the grown-up kids he’s known since school. Has it made things harder or easier, we wonder? “EASIER!” blasts Axwell back. “I think that your kid creates that balance.  But the reward is so massive, even travelling to Oz for thirty hours it’s worth it. When you’re travelling or in the studio, your time is limited so you make the most of it.”\n\nAnd what of Masquerade Motel, the Ibiza home of the Mafia? It’s a club concept that’s been picking up plaudits since the season begun. Is it a similar vibe to last year or different, we wonder? “I hope that it’s not too different,” says Axwell. “It’s just faster and more polished and we’re drinking more gasoline. I guess that the difference with Ibiza is it’s our second year so we have some routine and experience. The first year is about building your crowd so hopefully we can harvest some fruits from the crop we planted last year. I think we’re more relaxed. As for the club, it’s an intimate party vibe – we want you to feel like you’re a part of a private after-party.”\n\nThe other thing that’s changed is Swedish House Mafia have signed a 360 deal with Virgin/EMI. As they all acknowledge, it’s a Big Deal. Ingrosso again: “it’s a long term commitment and they’re involved in gigs and live shows as well as the music. SHM is bigger than any of us – and we needed a serious partner to control it and that’s what they do.” But who and what have Virgin/EMI signed exactly? It’s three people, three producers and three pairs of eyes and ears perfectly aligned together. And the deal is a huge step forward for dance music and DJ culture suggesting that major labels are showing faith in electronic music again. Their next single ‘Miami 2 Ibiza’, meanwhile, will feature Tinie Tempah. Axwell again: “I’m so pleased about this. It’s so nice to be a part of something that’s bigger than yourself. We all have our solo careers but this excites people on a different level.”\n\nSo life is looking good for the Mafia right now. “What we do: it’s a show,” reasons Seb. “Look at Brixton: it’s a show. People want confetti and they want to get something out of it. You can’t just DJ and look at your shoes! Now dance music is really big and we have an opportunity to take this further.” But we’ll leave it to Axwell to have the final word as he’s in a particularly thoughtful place at the end of the interview. “I think that it’s a lovely job to DJ and produce and share the passion for music that we have. It’s pretty simple and very natural. We’re not a manufactured thing – we’re musical brothers.”\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":52,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151597034069528","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/945601_10151597034069528_1818015107_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Sweden","general_manager":"amy@atmartists.com","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4661966,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/swedishhousemafia","location":{"street":"","zip":"","latitude":55.855982203217,"longitude":-4.2373707211282},"name":"Swedish House Mafia","record_label":"Virgin Records","talking_about_count":70689,"username":"swedishhousemafia","website":"http://www.onelasttour.com http://www.swedishhousemafia.com http://www.youtube.com/swedishhousemafia http://www.twitter.com/swedishousemfia http://www.facebook.com/axwellofficial http://www.facebook.com/sebingrosso http://www.facebook.com/steveangello","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Radiohead","id":"6979332244","info":{"id":"6979332244","about":"www.radiohead.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Thom Yorke \nJonny Greenwood\nColin Greenwood\nEd O'Brien\nPhilip Selway","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Oxford, UK","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":10255959,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/radiohead","name":"Radiohead","talking_about_count":70151,"username":"radiohead","website":"http://radiohead.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Dave Matthews Band","id":"6578860909","info":{"id":"6578860909","app_id":"0","band_members":"Carter Beauford\nStefan Lessard\nDave Matthews\nBoyd Tinsley\nTim Reynolds\nRashawn Ross\nJeff Coffin\n","bio":"The Dave Matthews Band formed in Charlottesville, Virginia, in early 1991, when vocalist/guitarist Dave Matthews decided to put some songs he had written on tape. Instead of simply recording himself with a guitar, he opted to bring in some instrumental help to give his musical ideas more depth. Dave found assistance in drummer Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore, who were both accomplished jazz musicians in the local Charlottesville music scene. Based on the recommendation of distinguished local jazz guru John D’earth, 16-year-old musical prodigy Stefan Lessard came on board to play bass. Completing the band was keyboard player Peter Griesar, who left the band after a couple of years, as well as the talented and classically trained violinist, Boyd Tinsley.\n\nThe first public performance of Dave Matthews Band occurred at the City of Charlottesville’s Earth Day Festival in April 1991. The first official gig for the newly conceived Dave Matthews Band was May 11, 1991, at a private party held on the rooftop of the pink warehouse on South Street in downtown Charlottesville. Local weekly gigs soon followed at Eastern Standard and then Trax nightclub, and within a little time, word of the band’s contagious new sound spread like wildfire throughout the region. Clubs started to fill up, tours began to cover more territory, and the fan base grew at an incredible rate.\n\nOn November 9, 1993, DMB released its first album, Remember Two Things, on its Bama Rags label. The album was recorded live at The Muse Music Club on Nantucket Island, in August of 1993. The album debuted on College charts as the highest independent entry, and went on to be certified gold by the RIAA -- a significant accomplishment for an independent album. Meanwhile, the band kept touring and its fan base continued to grow. By allowing fans to tape shows for their personal use, DMB created a highly interactive community that continues in spirit today.\n\nDuring the first part of 1994, Dave Matthews Band recorded its RCA debut, Under The Table and Dreaming. Just before the album’s release on September 27, 1994, Dave Matthews Band hit the road for their first official national tour. The tour lasted well over a year and included sold out theater dates across the country, a trip to Europe, and two summers playing on the main stage of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. By the fall of 1995, when the band returned to the studio to record its next album, Under The Table and Dreaming had been certified four times platinum by the RIAA.\n\nCrash, Dave Matthews Band’s second RCA studio album, was released on April 30, 1996, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The band continued with a steady schedule of touring throughout 1997, headlining sold-out amphitheater dates across North America. DMB, though elevated to the level of national pop stardom, continued to do things precisely as it had from day one: organically, with a grass roots mentality.\n\nOn October 28, 1997, Bama Rags/RCA label released an official double-disc live Dave Matthews Band album, entitled Live at Red Rocks 8-15-95. Without any marketing or promotion, Live at Red Rocks debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and was instantly certified platinum. The album provided fans with a high quality and reasonably priced alternative to the over-priced, ill produced, and illegal live DMB CDs that were beginning to flood the bootleg black-market. The overwhelming success of Live at Red Rocks, combined with the band’s tremendous touring achievements, proved that Dave Matthews Band had grown from a grass roots phenomenon to one of the hottest bands in America.\n\nOn April 28, 1998, RCA released Dave Matthews Band’s third studio album, Before These Crowded Streets. The critically acclaimed recording debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart; it was the band’s strongest debut to date. DMB spent the following year and a half on the road, selling out stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters across the country.\n\nOn January 19, 1999, Bama Rags/RCA released Live at Luther College: An Acoustic Performance by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. Tim Reynolds was a guest guitarist on all of the Dave Matthews Band albums, and toured with the band as a guest musician. Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds toured as an acoustic duo during the winters of ’96, ’97, and ’99. The second in a series of live Dave Matthews Band-related releases, Live at Luther College debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA . As with Live at Red Rocks, the success of this second live album was based solely on word-of-mouth buzz.\n\nThe third installment in the ongoing live album series, Listener Supported, was released by Bama Rags/RCA on November 23, 1999. The album was recorded live at New Jersey's Continental Airlines Arena in September 1999, and a video of the performance, also titled \"Listener Supported\", was released at the same time. The double-disc album was quickly certified double platinum, and the video has sold over a million copies as well.\n\nThe band spent much of 2000 on tour, finishing as the top-grossing touring band in the U.S. In the fall, Dave Matthews joined legendary producer Glen Ballard in Los Angeles to fine-tune song arrangements for a new album, and the pair wound up co-writing 12 new songs in a matter of days. From this explosion of creative chemistry came the band's fourth studio album, Everyday, released February 27, 2001. Matthews played electric guitar for the first time, and Ballard helped the band focus and tighten their arrangements, resulting in the phenomenal success of Everyday, which has since gone triple platinum.\n\nDMB spent the summer of 2001 touring the country and exposing sold-out audiences to songs from Everyday. On August 21, \"Dave Matthews Band, The Videos 1994-2001\", was released on DVD and VHS. For the first time, the entire collection of Dave Matthews Band videos (the first 12) was presented together, along with director commentary and behind the scenes footage.\n\nOn October 23, 2001, the band released its fourth live release, Live In Chicago, 12.19.98, featuring guest musicians such as Victor Wooten, Maceo Parker, and a full set with Tim Reynolds.\n\nThe band regrouped in January 2002 at the familiar Plant Studios in Sausalito, CA where they had recorded their 3rd RCA release Before These Crowded Streets. The band revisited tracks they had previously written and recorded in 2000 and collaborated on a couple of new tunes that had debuted in recent months. The resultant creation, Busted Stuff, was made available July 16, 2002. Busted Stuff is a landmark record for DMB; for the first time ever, this album is without any musical guests. Included on the album are road-tested fan favorites such as “Bartender”, “Grey Street”, “Where Are You Going”, and \"Grace Is Gone\".\n\nFollowing a successful tour throughout the US in Summer 2002, Dave Matthews Band released Live At Folsom Field, Boulder CO, the band's 5th live release overall. This double CD / DVD / VHS from the band's 7/11/01 performance, contains first ever live versions of songs from Everyday and Busted Stuff, such as \"When The World Ends,\" \"So Right,\" \"What You Are,\" \"If I Had It All,\" \"Angel,\" \"The Space Between,\" \"Everyday\" \"Big Eyed Fish,\" \"Digging A Ditch,\" and \"Bartender.\" The DVD utilizes footage taken from 22 cameras, was recorded in 5.1 surround sound, and presents the finest audio quality of any DMB live release to date. A short tour in several US cities in December of 2002 was highlighted by 2 sold out performances at Madison Square Garden. On 12/21 at MSG, to the surprise and delight of the audience, Dave Matthews Band was joined on stage by James Brown.\n\nThe band's 2003 summer tour culminated with a performance in New York’s Central Park in front of an estimated crowd of in excess of 100,000 fans. The concert helped raise $2 Million for public education and parks in New York City. In November 2003 The Central Park Concert was released on DVD and CD. Captured by 30 cameras in High Definition Widescreen video and recorded in stereo and 5.1 audio, the DVD was directed by Larry Jordan, who worked with the band previously on their Listener Supported.\n\nSummer/Fall 2003 also saw the release of the first solo projects from DMB with the release of Boyd's True Reflections and Dave's Some Devil. The first single from Some Devil, entitled \"Gravedigger,\" earned Dave a Grammy Award for \"Best Male Rock Vocal Performance\".\n\nDave Matthews began a tour in December 2003 to promote his album Some Devil. Dubbed \"Dave Matthews and Friends\" tour, Dave's \"Friends\" included: Trey Anastasio, Brady Blade, Tony Hall, Ray Paczkowski and Tim Reynolds. Emmylou Harris and Spyboy were special guests on the tour. The 12-date tour began in Pennsylvania and ended in California in January 04.\n\nSpring of 2004 found DMB at home in their Virginia studio rehearsing for the summer tour and beginning to mold some new tunes for their forthcoming studio album.\n\nDave Matthews Band's 2004 summer tour proved to be another stream of dynamite concert performances. New songs such as \"Hello Again\", \"Sugar Will\" and \"Joy Ride\" joined older favorites on the setlists. Days after the summer tour ended, DMB played in front of thousands of fans at a \"Concert to Benefit Bay Area Charities\" in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.\n\nIn the first few days of October, Dave Matthews Band joined forces with many other musicians on the \"Vote for Change\" Tour. Presented by MoveOn PAC, all proceeds from the tour benefited American Coming Together (ACT). The \"Vote for Change\" Tour was a multi-city, multi-artist tour that included 37 shows in 33 cities in 12 states over 11 days and featured artists such as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, Bonnie Raitt, Pearl Jam, REM and more.\n\nDMB Live Trax, a highly anticipated series of exclusive live releases, made its debut in the early fall. 12.8.98 Centrum, Worcester, MA was the first release and shortly thereafter, 9.12.04 Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA became the second live release in the new series.\n\nDave Matthews Band returned to the studio in the fall of 2004 and continued to shape their next album. Mark Batson, a well-known producer who met DMB in August after their Los Angeles show, was asked by DMB to come to Virginia and help produce the album.\n\nIn early 2005, Dave Matthews Band launched a website devoted to their new studio album. www.dmbnewstudioalbum.com provides fans with video footage and ongoing updates on the album's progress.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Dave Matthews Band made their first trip \"down under\", playing four theater shows in Australia as well as the renowned East Coast Blues & Roots Festival in Byron Bay, Australia. Back in the US, DMB played the 36th Annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival before releasing their acclaimed sixth studio album, Stand Up in May. The release of the album was celebrated by an intimate performance at the Roseland Ballroom in NYC.\n\nDave Matthews Band headlined the 4th Annual Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN and also hosted their own festival at the end of July, the two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island. DMB's Island Getaway included performances by Black Eyed Peas, Jem, Mike Doughty, Barenaked Ladies, Ray LaMontagne and Robert Randolph & the Family Band.\n\nFrom the first show of the 2005 summer tour in St. Louis to the four-show tour-ender at Red Rocks, the summer tour was epic and made all the more special by longtime lighting director, Fenton Williams' new stage set and lighting design. The fourth night at Red Rocks was added immediately after Hurricane Katrina struck. The concert, which featured the Neville Brothers on the bill, was a benefit for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Everyone from the concessionaires to the City of Denver pitched in and every cent related to the show -- over a million dollars total -- went to relief charities in the Gulf Coast.\n\nDMB, through their Bama Works Village Recovery Fund, partnered with CARE in 2005 to help tsunami-struck communities in eastern Sri Lanka put their lives back together. Monies donated to the Bama Works Village Recovery Fund are going to CARE to help empower local organizations in tsunami-affected areas to lead the economic and social recovery of their communities. All donations made through the DMB and Warehouse websites were matched 100% by Dave Matthews Band.\n\nDMB performed in Philadelphia, PA on July 2nd, a performance that was part of a series of free global concerts called \"Live 8\". \"Live 8\" concerts were held simultaneously in Philadelphia, PA; London, England; Rome, Italy; Paris, France and Berlin, Germany and were part of the ONE countdown to the G8 Summit. The concerts were part of a movement urging President Bush and other leaders of the world's 8 wealthiest nations to save millions of lives at the G8 Summit in Scotland July 5-8, 2005.\n\n2005 was definitely a year of CD releases. In addition to Stand Up, Live Trax 3, 8.27.2000 Meadows Music Theatre, Hartford, CT and Live Trax 4, 4.30.1996 Classic Amphitheatre, Richmond, VA were released in 2005 and recently, Dave Matthews Band released the Weekend on the Rocks and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks. Weekend on the Rocks features the highlights of all four nights, 9.9.05 - 9.12.05, at Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Complete Weekend on the Rocks features the four full-length shows. Both releases contain a DVD with video highlights of the Red Rocks performances.\n\nDave Matthews Band made a trip to New Orleans in late April 2006 for the annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.  Shortly before making the trip to Louisiana, DMB issued a $1.5 million challenge grant to help build the New Orleans Habitat Musicians’ Village.  The Village is a Habitat for Humanity project that seeks to build more than 300 homes in the city’s Upper Ninth Ward with musicians and other New Orleans residents who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe 2006 annual DMB summer tour found rare songs such as \"Dreaming Tree\" and \"Proudest Monkey\" being rediscovered and new songs like \"The Idea of You\", \"Sister\" and “Can’t Stop” making their debut.   The 2006 summer tour production was definitely one of the best yet with DMB taking the live experience to a new level.\n\nA high point in DMB’s career occurred on July 7-8, 2006 when the band performed back-to-back nights in historic Fenway Park with Sheryl Crow performing as support both evenings.  Due to feedback and a high demand from fans, within weeks, the Fenway Park concerts were offered as Live Trax volume 6.\n\nDave Matthews Band hosted the second annual two-day Island Getaway event at New York City's Randall Island in August. The 2006 Island Getaway included performances by Gov’t Mule, David Gray, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Slightly Stoopid, Yonder Mountain String Band and Tea Leaf Green. \n\nOther highlights of the summer tour included a return to Chicago with George Clinton performing and a two show tour-closer in DMB’s hometown of Charlottesville, VA, at the new state-of-the-art John Paul Jones Arena. \n\nIn October, Dave Matthews Band had the pleasure and honor of touring as special guest of the Rolling Stones for a show at the Sun Bowl in El Paso, TX and the Qwest Center in Seattle, WA.\n\n2006 was another year chock full of releases!  In addition to the rush release of the Fenway Park shows, a show from 1995 and 1996 were pulled out of the vaults based on requests from fans to release older shows in the Live Trax series.\n\nLive Trax 5: 8.23.1995 Meadow Brook Music Festival, Rochester Hills, MI\nLive Trax 6: 7.7 – 7.8.2006 Fenway Park, Boston, MA\nLive Trax 7: 12.31.1996 Hampton Coliseum, Hampton, VA\n\nIn October, DMB released its double CD, Best of What’s Around, Vol. 1, featuring the essential studio songs on one disc and a disc of live songs picked by fans from a survey DMB held earlier in the year.\n\nDave Matthews Band announced their plan in June to arrange for NativeEnergy and Clean Air-Cool Planet to offset 100% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from their touring activities since 1991. By offsetting the CO2 pollution that touring activities such as transporting gear, powering stages and air travel generate, Dave Matthews Band has taken a proactive role in fighting global warming and helping Native America to restore sustainable homeland economies in balance with the Earth.\n\nWith NativeEnergy, the band ensures that its CO2 offsetting actually contributes directly to the construction of new, Native American and Native Alaskan renewable energy generators whose clean electricity will displace energy that would otherwise have to come from polluting coal-fired plants, reducing CO2 and other pollution on behalf of the band. In addition, DMB’s purchase supports financially additional offsets from wind farms in the Great Plains, that displace electricity on one of the most intensely coal-fired grids in the country.\n\nDave Matthews Band wants to send thanks to those that have supported their tsunami relief efforts. In 2005, DMB, through their Bama Works Village Recovery Fund, partnered with CARE to help tsunami-struck communities in eastern Sri Lanka put their lives back together. The Bama Works Village Recovery Fund monies raised helped CARE to provide the following relief in 2006:\n\n    * CARE helped construct transitional housing for over 1,000 people who lost their homes to the tsunami.\n    * Going forward, CARE plans to construct 591 permanent homes for families in the area.\n    * CARE has constructed latrines, wells and water storage tanks for communities living in transitional shelters.\n    * Over 580 people from 12 villages were employed by CARE to clear garbage and debris from roads and farmland.\n    * CARE helped some 3,500 people regain their livelihoods by providing tools, supplies and cash grants.\n    * Other CARE programs supported schools and provided psychosocial support for those affected by the tsunami, especially people living in transitional shelters.\n\nDMB trekked the globe in 2007 with a return trip to Australia  as well as a European tour.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151861522255910","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/260519_10151861522255910_343528241_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":40},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Charlottesville, VA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":2961848,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/davematthewsband","name":"Dave Matthews Band","record_label":"RCA Records","talking_about_count":65912,"username":"davematthewsband","website":"www.davematthewsband.com\nwww.warehouse.davematthewsband.com\nwww.dmblive.com\nwww.twitter.com/davematthewsbnd\nwww.twitter.com/dmbcaravan\nwww.dmbcaravan.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Ariana Grande","id":"12384211026","info":{"id":"12384211026","about":"In the studio writing and recording my debut album.

You already know her as The Pussycat Dolls' lead singer, the one positioned way out front tempting listeners to loosen up her buttons. She was key to the group's success, selling upwards of seven million albums, touring the world, appearing as a guest vocalist on tracks by the likes of P. Diddy and Busta Rhymes, all accomplished in under three years and without missing a beat. Her name is Nicole Scherzinger. \n\nWhat you may not know is her story, which has its start in her birth state of Hawaii, a middle act in Kentucky, where she grew up, and the third (but far from last) chapter taking center stage as a true solo artist. Nicole's debut album may seem like an after-thought to the Dolls, but in fact, it's what she's been working towards all her life. Whether through her previous all-girl outfit, Eden’s Crush, who were born out of the reality TV series “Popstars,” or as the background singer for multi-platinum late ’90s rock group Days of the New, the part-Russian, part-Filipino, part-Hawaiian Nicole, whose nickname growing up was Hula, had her sights set on solo stardom for as long as she can remember. \"Some people's glasses can only be filled so high but I always knew there was never a limit to mine.  I always knew what I wanted,\" Nicole declares. \"People just see me as that girl from The Pussycat Dolls; I hear it all the time. They know 'Don't Cha,' which is amazing because it gets the attention and recognition, but as an artist, you need more to feed your soul, fill your glass. You need the music and that's what this album is all about… the music.\"  \n\nAll told, almost 100 songs were demoed or recorded for Her Name Is Nicole. “I had to try everything to find the music that would introduce and reflect me as a solo artist.  Music I was passionate about that would show the many different sides to my personality.\"  For her first effort, Nicole enlisted the help of old friends (will.i.am, Polow Da Don, Sean Garrett, Kara Dioguardi and Timbaland) and some new ones (Akon, Ne-Yo, Pharrell Williams, Macy Gray and Sting). “I love collaborating with a lot of different artists,” she explains. “I've been writing for the past 10 years but it's a different caliber when you've sold millions of albums and you're working with A-list writers and producers. I don't have the ego or confidence to be like, ‘Yeah, I'm one of those.’ And at the end of the day, I care most about the song. ” \n\n\"I recorded and wrote everywhere.  I was obsessed with my album.\"  The end result of her diligence, ambition and unbridled determination is the very definition of pop: music for the masses, but with a message and plenty of raw emotion. Take the deliciously addictive lead single, \"Baby Love,\" for example. \"The song wasn't about a beat, it's about real melodies that came from the heart,\" Nicole says of the track written with will.i.am and Kara Dioguardi. \"Kara and Will are geniuses and we wrote it in no more than 20 minutes.  \"I love the Hawaiian slack key, pedal steel in this song.  It's just another element that reflects my background.   I wanted to make sure I tried new things and sounds in the album that would separate it from other pop albums.  \n\n\"Supervillain,\" whose disco-inspired synth-heavy melody binds Nicole's five-octave range to another undeniable hook. \"It brought out the playful, fun, soulful side of me,\" she says. \"It felt like Motown!  I love Diana Ross, Roberta Flack and Dionne Warwick and when I first heard the song, which was produced by Madd Scientist, and written by Rock City, I thought, 'Man, this is like modern day Diana Ross!'\" \n\nTaking the drama up another notch is \"Physical.\" Produced by Timbaland, it brings out Nicole's rock roots, honed during her time on the road with Days of the New. \"I just had to have that song,\" she declares. \"The drums were so edgy and had so many unique sounds. I think it brings out another cool, wicked character that's in me. It's hot, a little theatrical with a rock-n-roll edge!\" \n\nOn the flip side is \"Just Say Yes,\" written by Gary Lightbody, lead singer of Snow Patrol. It is one of the five ballads on Her Name Is Nicole. The message of undying love resonated strongly with Nicole. \"Even though I didn’t write the song, it felt like it came from me,\" she says. \"It did more than speak to me, it lives in me.  Anyone who's ever experienced love or a relationship understands things pulling in different directions, but this song is about succumbing, opening up and giving yourself over to love. It's such an honest moment and is one of the most vulnerable songs I sang but I did it not caring what anyone else would think.\" \n\nOn the same tip, \"Save Me From Myself,\" written by Ne-Yo, also hit close to home. \"When Ne-Yo brought it to me, he hadn't written the bridge yet,\" she remembers. \"And I felt the song so much — Tears don't stop the rain / Rain don't hide the tears / The tears I've cried / I've felt my share of pain, my share of fears / But through it all, I'm not afraid — Everybody can relate to that feeling of being in a dark hour, where they need a little help. I asked Ne-Yo if he'd allow me to finish the song as I heard it in my head. And he did.\" \n\nNe-Yo's second writing credit comes by way of the much buzzed about track \"Happily Never After,\" another emotional ballad that brought Nicole to tears. \"I had that same story in my life,\" she explains. \"I had been in a relationship where I didn't know my self-worth, my self-dignity, and I didn't know how to get out. Then when I left, I realized that I am better than this and that I have to love myself before I can love anybody else. As simple as that sounds, it's so true. So when I heard the song, I said I have to sing it. It's important for me to get this empowering message out there for all the young girls so they can say I deserve better, I'm not going to settle, not in this relationship or in my life. I think they need to hear that.\"  \n\nOther music luminaries lending their skills to Her Name Is Nicole include Akon, who co-wrote \"When You're Falling,\" T.I., who appears on the club hit \"Whatever U Like,\" and Sting, who took time out from The Police reunion tour to record \"Power's Out\" while on a stop in Boston. \"Sting's part of the Interscope family, but I couldn't believe it when I was in the same studio with him. I tried to play it off like, it's cool, but I was literally shaking,\" she confesses. \"We took a picture together, and I've taken a million pictures but standing there next to Sting, it's a little different. It's like you're taking a picture for the very first time.\"  \n\nAnother first for this already proven pop star: using the name of a Hawaiian flower, Puakenikeni (pronounced poo-wah-kin-ee-kin-ee), as both a catch phrase and a chorus. \"I'm proud of my background and heritage,\" she says. \"Puakenikeni is one of my favorite flowers because it has the sweetest, most fragrant smells, so Akon and I came up with this fun, kitschy line, 'Don't you wanna pick my puakenikeni?' It's my shout out to my family and the islands! \"Hey, I get 'um!\" \n\nIt was a long road to travel for Nicole, whose parents couldn't afford acting or vocal lessons for their daughter while she was in her teens. To get around it, she enrolled in a performing arts high school and then paid her own way through college where she majored in theatre and acting and studied dance extensively.  \"Singing,\" she adds, \"was innate from the start.  It was almost like my first means of communication.\" But where “Popstars” or Days of the New could easily have been her last shot, Nicole saw every audition and career move as a stepping-stone.  \"I remember the first time I was put up in a hotel on the Sunset Strip, jumping on the bed and thinking, 'I'm a huge star.' It was my first big break, going on tour with Days of the New, but I was always recording, working with friends who had studios and knowing that one day, I was going to make it on my own. I was always working towards this moment.\"  \n\nIn fact, when Nicole first tried out for The Pussycat Dolls, and was quickly cast based on her raw talent and experience, she negotiated a solo deal then and there. \"When they asked me to join the group I knew that was the window of opportunity I had been waiting for my entire life so I said 'You have to give me a solo contract as well.  I knew I would earn my stripes in time and, well, here I am talking about Her Name Is Nicole.\" \n\nIt's that tenacity which lies at the core of Nicole's entire being, and has been there ever since she was a child. \"When I think about it, I have a crazy story,\" she bemuses. \"Coming from little money and zero connections… I could have stopped with The Pussycat Dolls, selling seven million albums, but this is a mountain I have been determined to climb. The song 'March' that I wrote best explains it…'If you can see it and believe it and put in the work, well then it's only just a matter of time!'\"\n\nSo what IS success to Nicole Scherzinger, the solo artist? \"People connecting to my music. If it reminds them of something, or if it makes them feel good, emotional, or if it just makes them want to dance or sing out, that's all I can ask for!  This music comes from my heart and when people hear it, they will get to know me.\"","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151449369722433","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/s720x720/480123_10151449369722433_868477875_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Santa Monica, CA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4588478,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/nicolescherzinger","name":"Nicole Scherzinger","record_label":"Interscope Records","talking_about_count":63719,"username":"nicolescherzinger","website":"http://www.nicolescherzingermusic.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Ozzy Osbourne","id":"5461947317","info":{"id":"5461947317","about":"www.ozzy.com","app_id":"0","bio":"Ozzy Osbourne’s career has spanned four decades and his music is as relevant today as ever. On any given day you can hear his music blasting at sporting events, in the movies, on the radio, in TV commercials, video games or on your iPod.    Ozzy’s not only a legend and an icon, but is a pioneer in his genre of music.  He has helped open the door for countless bands by giving them their big break by taking them on tour or by taking them on Ozzfest, his all-day metal festival which is now in its 13th year.   Ozzy also opened the door for celebrities to have their own reality TV shows (although I’m not sure he wants to take credit for that).\n \nOzzy has always been an innovator.  He leads and others follow.  He was the first front man to leave a hugely successful band and have equal or greater success as a solo artist.  He was the first to have his own hard rock/metal touring festival.   He was the first to have a celebrity-reality television program.   There’s no doubt that Ozzy’s impact will be felt for generations to come. \n \nHere are some milestones from Grammy Award-winning Ozzy Osbourne’s 38-year career:\n\nTHE SEVENTIES:\n•\tOzzy releases his first record with Black Sabbath in 1970 (released Friday, February    13th).

When he was only 8 years old, he appeared on TV and sang Yallee Ta..ebney Seneen Feh Hawak. The young singer was able to capture everyone's attention with his soft and soothing voice. But this was only the beginning; from then on more and more fame kept coming Wael..s way. Now, that the young star knew exactly what he wanted and how to achieve it, he was off to establish himself as a talented singer. Jassar then started working with famous figures from the music industry. The famous stars included people like Jamil Nahas and Jamil Ayoub. Soon after that, he released his first album \"Kelmet Wada..a Beta..zebne\". Wael then collaborated with Nicholas Nakhla and the songwriter Mohamed Mady. His single Ya Tayer followed soon after. The single was a huge success and made it to the top of the charts regionally. This collaboration continued as a result of the success achieved by the song. His second album \"El-Dounia Alemetny\" was next to come and it dazzled the singer's fans. Jassar's third album Allah Yekhalehoum was no different from the previous albums when it came to success and popularity. \"A..al Jamar\" came later on to further the singer's already growing popularity and prove his talent.

Chris Brown & Wiz Khalifa on iTunes Now!! http://smarturl.it/beatit?IQid=f","app_id":"0","band_members":"Sean Kingston","bio":"For his third-full length album Back 2 Life, Sean Kingston immensely expanded his songwriting role, nixed the multi-producer approach of his last release, and pushed for a fresh new sound. Like his 2007 self-titled debut (featuring the double-platinum breakout hit “Beautiful Girls”) and 2009’s Tomorrow (featuring the smash singles “Fire Burning” and “Face Drop”), Back 2 Life boldly fuses reggae, hip-hop, R&B, and electro to create melody-soaked pop. But on Back 2 Life, the singer/songwriter blends his newly strengthened vocals with fiercely inventive electronic effects and hard-hitting live instrumentation to offer up his most passionately inspired work to date.\n\nFor Kingston, the urge to achieve the powerfully vibrant sound that permeates Back 2 Life was born during his recovery from a devastating accident. In May 2011, while jet skiing in Miami Beach, Kingston crashed into a bridge and suffered a shattered wrist, broken jaw, and water in his lungs. After spending nearly a month in the hospital and undergoing two emergency open-heart surgeries to repair a torn aorta, the Jamaica-bred 22-year-old headed to his Miami Beach home and took two months to heal—and start plotting his return to the studio. “I couldn’t go anywhere while I was recovering, so I spent all my time writing songs and listening to beats,” recalls Kingston. “All I wanted was to get back to doing music, which is what I’ve been devoting my life to since I was eight-years-old.”\n\nFully healed and ready to record, Kingston flew to Los Angeles in September and began working on Back 2 Life. Teaming up with Jonathan “J.R.” Rotem (who served as producer on Kingston’s first two albums and has also worked with artists like Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, 50 Cent, Rick Ross, Flo Rida, and Britney Spears), Kingston set out to tap into his musical roots. “After the accident, I was really humbled and felt the need to get back to my culture,” says Kingston, who was born in Miami but moved to Jamaica when he was seven. “This album’s much more organic than anything I’ve done before—the music’s real and it hits you on a gut level.” \n\nIndeed, Back 2 Life emerges as Kingston’s most richly eclectic and ambitious album so far. On the album’s lead single “Back 2 Life (Live It Up),” for instance, Kingston samples the vocals from Soul II Soul classic of the same name and twists the lyrics into a triumphant call to action. Sweeping and celebratory, the song mixes pummeling beats with chilling synth effects and Kingston’s fearless assertion that “what won’t kill me makes me stronger.” After a masterful guest rap from T.I., “Back 2 Life (Live It Up)” dissolves into a stripped-down pairing of sampled vocals and delicate piano work that’s both stark and stunning.\n\nAlthough Kingston keeps up that heady intensity throughout Back 2 Life, many of the tracks are built on party-ready hooks and amped-up spirit. With its fat, bouncy, hip-swinging beats, “Bomba” combines flamenco-flavored acoustic guitars, soaring vocals, and pounding live percussion in the sonic equivalent of some epic beach party. On the sweetly anthemic, stadium-ready “100,000 People” (featuring Wiz Khalifa), Kingston gets romantic as he serenades a girl who’s “got them curves like a race track,” claiming that “I can pick you out of 100,000 people.” And on “Born To Be Wild” (an infectiously playful number inspired by a hotel-room revisiting of The Lion King), Kingston backs a sample of The Tokens’ “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” with a hotstepping beat and lovestruck lyrics about his very own “queen of the jungle.”\n\nElsewhere on Back 2 Life Kingston explores post-breakup heartache, with tracks like “Voices” (a frenetic, handclap-driven powerhouse) perfectly capturing the torment of obsessing over your ex. The sweet and breezy “She’s Just Not You” also looks at lovesick infatuation, this time taking a doo-wop-meets-dancefloor approach that includes gently strummed guitar, swaying harmonies, and throbbing beats (“That song’s me talking about the end of a relationship with a girl who was everything to me,” explains Kingston, “and how the next girl could be perfect—a girl straight out of a movie or off the cover of a magazine—but none of that matters ‘cause she’s just not you”). One of Back 2 Life’s most high-drama moments, “Piano” begins as a tender ballad then warps into synth-drenched kiss-off to a no-good girl. Propelled by heartbeat-like percussion and Kingston’s pained lyrics about the one who “crushed my soul” and “took my world,” “Piano” crests with a flurry of strings and a hauntingly sorrowful opera sample.\n\n“This album’s a really honest reflection of where I’m at in my life right now,” says Kingston. “I’m proud that it shows everything, because it shows my growth too.” No doubt, Kingston’s come a long way since he first began recording songs on the tiny personal studio his mother bought him when he was 11-years-old. Back then, Kingston would whip up his own reggae-pop hybrids and perform them local block parties and talent shows in Miami (to which he returned after spending several years living with his father in Kingston, Jamaica). But when his mother was convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud and sent to federal prison, the 15-year-old Kingston had to put his music dreams on temporary hold. After a brief period of homelessness, Kingston began bouncing around the homes of his friends and relatives and ultimately landed a lawn-mowing job to earn the money he needed to make a demo. Thanks largely to Kingston’s dogged persistence in pursuing every hit-making producer he could find online, that demo ended up getting him signed to Rotem’s then-newly-launched label Beluga Heights in 2006—a deal quickly followed by a joint contract with Epic Records and the release of a debut album that went on to sell more than a million copies worldwide and spawn three back-to-back Top 10 singles. To date Sean has sold more than 12.5 million tracks. \n\n“A lot’s happened over the past few years—I’ve traveled the world and had relationships and dealt with breakups, so I’m singing from the heart about things that I actually went through,” says Kingston. In capturing the most momentous of those experiences—the accident that nearly cost him his life—Kingston sought to stay positive and focus on his deepened sense of strength and gratitude. “My accident really slowed me down for a while and changed the way I look at things,” he says. “I knew I needed to address that on the album, but my goal was to do it in an upbeat sort of way. So the songs on Back 2 Life are catchy and uptempo and everyone can have a great time to them, but at the same there’s no doubt that it’s all the way real.”\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151562865458750","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/11910_10151562865458750_1854356159_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"description":"Request My Brand New Single \"BEAT IT\" At Your Local Radio Stations Everywhere!!!!!!!!","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Miami Florida -Kingston, Jamaica","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":7979474,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/seankingston","name":"Sean Kingston","record_label":"Epic Records","talking_about_count":54391,"username":"seankingston","website":"seankingston.com www.twitter.com/seankingston www.instagram.com/seankingston","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Manika","id":"155224321175801","info":{"id":"155224321175801","about":"New music video \"My Way\"!! \n CLICK HERE --> http://youtube.com/ManikaOfficial ;) \nTWEET ME :) http://twitter.com/manikaofficial I tweet back!","app_id":"0","band_members":"This is the official page for MANIKA (Ma -NEE -ka)\n\nOfficial Website: http://ManikaOfficial.com/\n\nYoutube: https://youtube.com/ManikaOfficial\n\nTwitter: @manikaofficial https://twitter.com/ManikaOfficial\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/ManikaOfficial\n\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/ManikaOfficial\n\nTumblr: http://ManikaOfficial.tumblr.com\n\nPheed: http://pheed.com/ManikaOfficial\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/ManikaOfficial","bio":"Manika (pronounced Ma-NEE-ka) was discovered by Frank DiLeo, Michael Jackson’s long-time manager.  Manika moved from her hometown Las Vegas to Hollywood where her musical career blossomed. That first summer, Manika headlined Pepsi’s Shop Till You Rock Tour across America.  She also performed live at several radio stations, local and national TV and schools in cities across America.  Some major events Manika performed at include the Hollywood Style Awards, the nationally-televised Hallmark Hollywood Christmas Parade, and the popular Girl Scouts’ 100th Anniversary Tour.  Less than a year into her career, Manika performed at sold-out arenas in over 20 cities across North America with the most popular boy-band in the world – One Direction.\n\nManika has four million fans on Facebook and Twitter and over four million YouTube views.  You can visit her social sites at:  www.facebook.com/ManikaOfficial, www.twitter.com/ManikaOfficial, www.youtube.com/ManikaOfficial, www.instagram.com/ManikaOfficial, www.ManikaOfficial.com.\n\nBringing a fresh, edgy vibe to mainstream pop and unafraid to boldly speak her mind, Manika came out of the gate with two Top-50 hits: 1) \"Just Can't Let You Go\" featuring Young Money's Lil’ Twist and 2) \"Good Girls\" produced by the renowned Soulshock.  Manika is now releasing her third single: “My Way”…an anthem for teens that inspires the young to listen to their hearts and be strong.\n\nPrior to her musical success, Manika wrote and published The Exciting Adventures of Boo, a children’s book.  She donated the proceeds of the first 750 books ($15,000) to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and served as their teen spokesperson.  Manika also read her book to inner-city schoolchildren and young cancer patients. Her experiences with the underprivileged and unfortunate inspired one of her songs on her debut double-album (to be released in coordination with her single “My Way”).  She wrote this very personal song “Through the Eyes of the Young” alone and from her heart, and she plans to donate the proceeds to St. Jude Children’s Hospital.\n\nManika continually participates in charity causes during her young music career.  In her hometown of Las Vegas, she led the bike drive for 98.5 KLUC’s annual Christmas Toy Drive…breaking the record for the number of bikes donated.  Manika performed at her own expense (never accepting payment) at the safe-texting event for KRUF-FM in Shreveport, LA.  Manika had her picture taken as part of the well-known NOH8 movement.  She attends anti-bullying causes.  And she helped build a house with Habitat for Humanity.  Someday, Manika plans to start her own charity.\n\nLegendary manager of Michael Jackson, the late Frank DiLeo, said this about Manika: “Manika is a supernova ready to explode. She is a very rare and unique talent, who can do it all. She sings, she acts, she writes and delivers everything with her trademark style of sassiness and soul. I can’t wait for the rest of the world to discover her. The Kid has it.”  Shortly before his tragedy, Mr. DiLeo announced: “I am coming out of retirement to manage one last big act: Manika.” \n\nHere are a few examples of recent media coverage of Manika:\n\n“Lady Gaga and Katy Perry are likely shaking in their platform shoes.

Ace Hood & Busta Rhymes\nhttps://soundcloud.com/yasimelike/come-and-get-it","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"Joey Galaxy aka Young Cash, Tay Dizm, One Chance, Field Mob, Shawnna","band_members":"T-Pain","bio":"Few people can accurately say they’ve changed the course of music; count T-Pain among that short list.  His bright, polished arrangements have become the in-demand sound across genres, and his scene-stealing vocal performances are among the most coveted in music. Since bursting on the scene in 2005, T-Pain has been awarded a Grammy, produced and written a plethora of chart-topping and platinum-selling singles, garnered \"Songwriter of the Year\" and \"Producer of the Year\" honors at the BMI Urban Awards and earned a BET Award. So it should come as little surprise that the musical maestro’s tremendous, self-produced third album, THR33 RINGZ, stands as a sonic odyssey brimming with innovation.\n\nThe distinctive spelling used for the album title may not hold any significance, but the meaning behind the name carries weight.  “It came from people telling me that I’m running the game, that I’m the ringleader of the game,” T-Pain says humbly. “That’s where the whole circus imagery came from. I started putting it together with the idea that the circus is just like the music industry. You’ve got your different acts, all of the different animals, etc.”\n\nTHR33 RINGZ is quite the musical journey, complete with highs and lows, smash singles and unexpected twists. Lead single “Can’t Believe It” is already enjoying heavy radio and video exposure.  Aided by sprinkly keys and T-Pain’s trademark vocoder, he and guest Lil Wayne talk about spoiling their respective ladies in the song. There’s good reason T-Pain’s music often connects with and speaks to women.  He had plenty of training dealing with the fairer sex.  \n\n“When I was in school, I would sit and talk to a lot of girls,” T-Pain recalls. “I would listen to what they would talk about, what they want. I would try to understand the passions of a woman. That’s where my concepts come from. That’s how you know if people can relate to your songs.  If you’ve heard the same elements of a story over and over again, you know there are millions of people going through this.”  \n\nSince his schoolroom listening sessions, T-Pain has kept his ears open. In fact, listening to several sob stories inspired “Therapy,” a tune where T-Pain and Kanye West talk about women who need to get themselves together. T-Pain then details relationships with negative energy on “Chopped & Screwed” a track that features Ludacris. But T-Pain’s music isn’t all about drama. He also listens to his friends when they gush about a special someone. The party track “Freeze,” for instance, grew out of conversation T-Pain had with Chris Brown.  Brown, who also appears on the high-energy song, was telling T-Pain how he finds women that can dance particularly attractive.  \n\nOf course T-Pain’s long-time fans know that he especially appreciates women who dance in strip clubs.  But he knows from first-hand experience how men often fall victim to DJs who switch songs up too quickly when they’ve just paid for a lap dance. Hence, the five-minute plus “Long Lap Dance.”  “In Florida, strippers charge for lap dances by the song,” T-Pain explains. \n“If you just so happen to ask a girl for a lap dance in the middle of a song and the DJ cuts it off, you still have to pay the full price.  So I just made a long song, so whenever you ask for it, you should be good.  And the DJs know that they can’t cut it off, ‘cause then it wouldn’t be the ‘Long Lap Dance’ song.”\n\nWith his music being largely based on real-world encounters, it makes sense that T-Pain recorded “Reality Show,” a tune that details some of his wild experiences.  “At certain times, everybody’s like, ‘I need my own reality show because the stuff I’m going through is crazy,’” T-Pain says with a laugh. “I don’t know why you’d want the world to see everything you’re going through, but nobody’s done a reality show song yet.”\n\nReality shows are filled with drama, and T-Pain’s existence is no different.  When he gets angry, T-Pain is likely to end up rapping, as is the case on “Ring Leader Man,” “Karaoke” with DJ Khaled and the title track.  “If I’m upset, then it’s going to be a rap day,” T-Pain says with a chuckle. “I make music depending on what mood I’m in.  If I’m pissed off, I can’t get on there and talk about love.”\n\nEven though T-Pain sometimes finds himself in an angry mood, he remains grounded because of his wife and children. His family is also the inspiration for THR33 RINGZ song “Keep Going.” This acoustic tune stands as a testament to T-Pain’s dedication to his family. “I want to make sure that my kids live a good life,” he says.  “I don’t want them to have to figure out the hard way what a food stamp is. I’ve slept in cars.  I went through a lot in my life and I’m going to make sure that if somebody’s life is in my hands that they’re not going to have to go through that.”\n\nIndeed, T-Pain can speak from that perspective because he knows what it is like to struggle. His Tallahassee, Florida hometown was lacking music industry opportunities and connections, so the man born Faheem Najm chose the T-Pain moniker to signify his plight.  He taught himself how to make music, write songs and record music.  \n\nIn 2003, T-Pain’s sly remake of Akon’s “Locked Up” caught the attention of music industry insiders, and the independent release of his “I’m Sprung” single led to a contract with Zomba Recordings.\n\nT-Pain’s use of the vocoder made his music stand out, and his prolific, high-quality output turned him into one of music’s most oft-imitated and in-demand producers, singers and collaborators.  His first two albums, 2006’s Rappa Ternt Sanga and 2007’s Epiphany, have been certified gold, thanks to hit singles such as “I’m N Luv (Wit A Stripper)” and “Buy U A Drank (Shawty Snappin’).”  He has also collaborated with Kanye West (Good Life), Chris Brown (“Kiss Kiss”) Flo Rida (Low) Plies (Shawty) and Bow Wow (“Outta My System”) for platinum singles.\n\nNow, as T-Pain gains more control over his artistry, expect him to continue expanding his sonic and creative reach as a singer-songwriter-rapper-producer.  After all, he knows the key to long-term success in the music industry is evolution.  “You’ve got to be different and keep it consistent at the same time, which is super-hard to do,” T-Pain says.  “I come different every time and that’s what people look for, what they expect.”\n\nAnd with THR33 RINGZ, the world expects nothing less than another magical musical adventure from T-Pain.  Expectation achieved.","booking_agent":"For the U.S., contact Mark Cheatham at CAA (mcheatham@caa.com).

Tras varios años y luego de haber pertenecido a diferentes agrupaciones por las que desfilaron siendo adolescentes, algunos de los ahora integrantes deciden reunirse para formar su propio proyecto musical y durante más de un año planearon el nacimiento de la nueva banda.\n\nFinalmente en 2003, nace banda MS en Mazatlán, Sinaloa, de donde toman las iniciales para darle el nombre al grupo; aquí sus fundadores lograron conjuntar sus ideas e inquietudes para ofrecerle a la gente una propuesta diferente e original, empleando su propia fórmula, pues aparte de hacer música sinaloense de calidad, le imprimen su toque alegre y ágil. \n\nCon metas firmes la banda inició con 15 integrantes y siempre con el propósito de brillar con luz propia y lograr trascender. Hoy en día, banda MS ha dado pasos muy grandes y lejos de ser una banda sinaloense más, se ha convertido en una exitosa banda. A pesar de su corta trayectoria, banda MS es una de las más firmes y de las que más se habla en la actualidad. \n\nSu primer disco hizo su debut en el año 2004 titulado No podrás, del cual los temas \"No Podrás\" y \"La Suata\" fueron muy solicitados en las estaciones radiales locales, ambos temas son de la autoría de su vocalista Oswaldo Silvas. Poco tiempo después se decide integrar a Alan Manuel Ramírez Salcido, como segundo vocalista de la agrupación, ya que con dos voces la agrupación busco ofrecer una versatilidad a las interpretaciones de sus temas.\n\nUn año después, lanzan el álbum titulado Mi mayor anhelo, cuyo primer sencillo fue la canción “Ayer la vi por la calle”, un tema de corte ranchero que sonó muy bien a nivel local; el segundo sencillo fue el homónimo del título del disco, el cual también resulto ser muy bien aceptado tanto Sinaloa, sino también fuera del mismo. “Mi mayor anhelo” se colocó en los primeros lugares en las estaciones de radiales en Sinaloa, e incluso fue premiada como “El Mejor Tema del Año”. Posteriormente graban y lanzan el disco titulado La raza contenta, en donde se incluyen sólo corridos, destacando \"El 24\" y \"Chuy y Mauricio\", canciones que hicieron más popular a banda MS. \n\nLa producción musical titulada Escuela de rancho sale en el año 2007 y de aquí se desprendió el tema “El mechón”, canción que se convirtió en todo un suceso y que los catapulto en México y Estados Unidos. Gracias a esta canción obtuvieron el reconocimiento al “Mejor tema bailable” en la Unión Americana. Con un estilo musical arrancherado, versátil y original, banda MS se ha distinguido desde sus inicios por ser diferente de las demás agrupaciones; por ejemplo, al llevar en sus trajes números que distinguen a cada uno de los integrantes y cuyo significado es personal (día de cumpleaños, fecha de nacimiento de un hijo, algún aniversario, etc.).\n","booking_agent":"Sergio Lizarraga","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":448721481848707,"source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/417989_448721481848707_509329059_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Mazatlan, Sinaloa","description":"Esta página fue creada por BANDA MS y PROMOCIONES ARROLLADORAS, S.A.

It's scary. It almost makes me not want to stop because I could be missing out on these wonderful songs. They're out there for the taking--you've just got to grab them.\"\n\nTogether with bassist Mark Stoermer, guitarist Dave Keuning, and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Flowers helped to mold the album into 10 songs that work best together as a whole, each individually describing an evolution of the Las Vegas band's sound. \"We're always pushing ourselves,\" says Stoermer, \"and there's a lot of diversity here--from anthemic rock to dance songs.\"  Flowers adds: \"We felt like Sam's Town was a continuation of Hot Fuss, and we feel like this is a continuation of Sam's Town.  But at the same time, Day and Age is totally different from both of them, while still sounding like us.  It's kind of looking at Sam's Town from Mars.\"\n\nThose familiar with the band's oeuvre will recognize their signature in the synth-heavy \"Human,\" four minutes of sweeping, epic rock, on which Flowers sings: \"My sign is vital/ My hands are cold/ And I'm on knees, looking for the answer/ Are we human, or are we dancer?\" He says the lyrics were inspired by a disparaging comment made by Hunter S. Thompson about how America was raising a generation of dancers. But the song also had some help from album producer Stuart Price (aka Jacques LuCont), known for his work with Madonna and Missy Elliot, and who'd previously remixed \"Mr. Brightside.\"  \"He was the icing on the cake,\" says Stoermer.\n\n\"We had just put 'Human' together, and we wound up shooting over to his house after dinner [in London],\" Flowers recalls of his first time in the studio with Price. \"A few hours later, we had something very close to what you hear now. I was on cloud nine.\" He continues: \"When we walked into his flat, the first thing I saw was picture of the cover of The Man Who Sold the World, and further down the stairs there was a picture of Eno in his Roxy Music days. I just kind of felt that we'd found our man.\"\n\nThat he'd find comfort in the signifiers of those artists shouldn't come as a surprise: The band's made no secret of their admiration for both art-rock and stadium giants (collaborating with the likes of Lou Reed, who guested on \"Tranquilize,\" a single from Sawdust, 2007's collection of B-sides, rarities, and new songs). Formed in Las Vegas in 2002, the band belongs to the lineage of high-energy rock bands that manage to be both commercially successful and critically acclaimed (both of their studio albums have received endless column inches bursting with praise), and it's almost mind-blowing to consider that without the classifieds section of a local paper, they might have never been. \n\nFlowers first met guitarist Keuning while perusing said classifieds for fellow musicians; when Dave's ad mentioned The Beatles, Oasis and more, Flowers knew he was on the right track. They claimed the name The Killers (taken from the bass drum of a fictional band in a New Order video), and eventually recruited Stoermer and Vannucci into the fold, all of them agreeing that there seemed to be an intangible something to the music they were making, as well as the response they were generating from people who saw them play.  And as these performances became bigger and bigger, and praise for the band began to spread rapidly, A&R men came from the UK and the US to see them, eventually leading them to sign with Island Records in America.  Their debut, Hot Fuss, catapulted them onto the global stage upon its 2004 release, selling millions of copies around the world.  The band toured for two years straight behind Hot Fuss, playing more than four-hundred shows, and eventually returned to Vegas to begin to work on the follow-up album with legendary producers Alan Moulder and Flood.  The result, a love letter of sorts to their hometown entitled Sam's Town, was released in 2006 and spent forty-two weeks on the Billboard Top 200.  In between all of this, the band managed to fit in two appearances on Saturday Night live, in addition to performances on The Tonight Show, The Late Show with David Letterman and more.  One might think this would produce a generous amount of pressure as the band began to work on their newest collection of songs, but this was not the case.  \"We're confident together, comfortable with the way we work as a live band,\" Stoermer says. \"So when we were writing this record, there was less anxiety, not that we're resting on our laurels.\"\n\nThis comfort in their work together is apparent on Day & Age.  The album sees The Killers experimenting with different instruments: \"I Can't Stay\" has a tropical sound--thank the saxophone and steel drums--and, as the singer says, \"could be the most perfect pop song we've ever written.\" \"Losing Touch,\" meanwhile, is a gorgeous uptempo track with bright horns and grim lyrics (\"impending doom, it must be true/ I'm losing touch\") that lend it an ominous vibe. \"Spaceman,\" an unabashedly arena-sized glam-rock number whose associative lyrics reference, among other themes, alien abduction. (\"We've been playing it between 'Read My Mind' and 'Mr. Brightside,' and it feels like it's been there forever,\" Flowers says.)  More than anything, The Killers are excited for their fans to hear what they've been creating, though, says Stoermer, \"We're always a little nervous about whether people are going to like it.\"\n\nThe people have in the past. Besides the sales figures--including moving 4.4 million units of Sam's Town abroad--the band has received seven nods from the Grammys, and won a variety of MTV, BRIT, and NME awards. They've headlined some of the biggest festivals in the UK and Europe, including Glastonbury, the Reading and Leeds Festival and Pukkelpop, and have sold out prestigious venues such as Madison Square Garden in America.  The attention has, at times, made it difficult for them to keep their composure, but this time out the band is trying to remain more level-headed.\n\n\"We got thrown up to the position very quickly that we're in now --the test is to retain it,\" says Flowers. \"I want us to be a positive force. People think that we're overconfident and cocky, but it comes from excitement. It's not 'I'm better than you,' it's that I can't wait till you hear this song because I know what it does to me physically. I'm able to listen to our songs and not think 'this is us playing,' I'm able to allow the music to affect me and I know if it's good or not. Sometimes people think I'm running my mouth, when I'm truly excited.\"","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151254612255695","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/227845_10151254612255695_1785502639_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8198212,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Thekillers","name":"The Killers","record_label":"Island Records","talking_about_count":46590,"username":"Thekillers","website":"http://www.thekillersmusic.com/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Lata Mangeshkar","id":"104003306305040","info":{"id":"104003306305040","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"Lata Mangeshkar is an Indian singer, and occasional music-composer.

She is the elder sister of singer Asha Bhosle, Hridayanath Mangeshkar, Usha Mangeshkar and Meena Mangeshkar. She is the second vocalist to have ever been awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.Mangeshkar was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records from 1974 to 1991 for having made the most recordings in the world. The claim was that she had recorded approximately 25,000 solo, duet, and chorus-backed songs in 20 Indian languages between 1948 to 1974. Over the years, while several sources have supported this claim, others have raised concerns over its veracity, claiming that this number was highly exaggerated and that Mangeshkar's younger sister, Asha Bhosle, had more song recordings than she had.

That's right—after numerous nights in front of packed arenas and amphitheaters, things are just beginning to come together for this accomplished band of brothers, led by one of the most charismatic individuals ever to don a beanie and dominate radio.\n\nThe band's latest album 'Uncaged' (Atlantic/Southern Ground) which debuted at #1 on Billboard 200 is proof positive. The result of a highly collaborative process, it's the sound of a group of versatile musicians gelling into a formidable unit and realizing they're capable of anything their fearless leader happens to dream up, from traditional country (\"The Wind\") to Caribbean rhythms (\"Jump Right In\") and even slinky bedroom R&B (\"Overnight\"). Running roughshod over genre boundaries, and bringing its audience along for the ride, its title is absolutely accurate—this is truly the sound of a band 'Uncaged'.\n\n\"I think that we've grown so much over the past few years as individual musicians and as a cohesive unit,\" observes drummer Chris Fryar. \"As a band we have really grown together. And we play really, really well together. That increasing level of maturity really shows up on 'Uncaged.'\"\n\n\"We're always trying to push the barrier of our musicianship and I'm proud to say that there is a little bit of something for everyone,\" adds Brown. \"It's your basic country-Southern rock-bluegrass-reggae-jam record.\"\n\nThe addition of percussionist Daniel de los Reyes has helped the band move the groove along. His new bandmates describe de los Reyes—known for performing and recording with Stevie Nicks, Sting, Peter Frampton and Earth, Wind & Fire, among others—as a consummate professional. \"It was really great to have him along,\" says guitarist/keyboardist Coy Bowles. \"Danny's not going to be playing timbales over a bluegrass song. So if he needs to play a shaker all the way through a song, that's what he'll do. He knows when to be aggressive and when to lay back. I think the album has a real cool dynamic because of his sensitivity to all that.\"\n\nBrown has built a virtual southern Brill Building of songwriting talent, while doing his best to reincarnate the '70s heyday of Capricorn Records through his Southern Ground Artists label, home to The Wood Brothers, Levy Lowrey, Nic Cowan, Sonia Leigh, Blackberry Smoke and The Wheeler Boys. But that's only part of the story. His Southern Ground banner flies over everything from metalworking to leather goods. In addition to housing offices and rehearsal space, the former industrial warehouse in Atlanta that serves as the company's headquarters also features a full kitchen for \"Chef Rusty\" Hamlin and his crew, the better to power those much-talked-about \"eat and greets\" that Brown, a former restaurant owner, hosts for lucky fans.\n\nThe most farsighted plans reach beyond the warehouse, to a plot of land south of Atlanta where plans proceed for a nonprofit camp aimed to help kids overcoming behavioral and learning disabilities and disadvantaged backgrounds. Simultaneously, Southern Ground has secured a studio in Nashville for future recording needs. At this point it's safe to say that the Zac Brown Band is more than an act—it's quickly becoming a way of life. \n\nSo given all of the creative energy around it, new material has never been a problem for Zac Brown Band. The band was originally built on the songwriting partnership of Zac Brown and Wyatt Durette. Since then the brain trust has expanded to encompass the artists on the label as well as members of the band. No matter how heavily the band is touring, something is always percolating.\n\nSo while there are ten credited songwriters on the 11 tracks composing 'Uncaged,' all are individuals within the band's social circle—no \"guns for hire\" here. \n\nUnlike the band's prior outing, 'You Get What You Give' (Atlantic/Southern Ground), which grew out of songs that had already been in the band's live set before it entered the studio, 'Uncaged' was put together from brand new material. After booking some downtime, they all retreated to the Appalachian foothills near Dahlonega. \"It had a very cleansing vibe to it,\" Fryar recalls. \"You get really bad cell service there, which was great. There weren't any distractions. We were able to cut off the outside world and dig into what we wanted to say on this record.\"\n\nThey carried with them some 40 songs, none of which had been fleshed out or arranged for the band, and some of which weren't completely done. The goal of the retreat was to pull out and arrange the right 11 songs.\n\n\"It was an intensive workshop,\" notes bassist John Driskell Hopkins. \"We hit the record button any time we had an idea worth keeping. Then we'd change things as we went. And we did that in a great place to build a campfire, cook some food, hang out and have some fellowship too. I'm amazed that we got so much done in just four or five days. \"\n\nThen, with producer Keith Stegall (Alan Jackson, George Jones) in tow, the band settled in at Echo Mountain Recording Studio in Asheville, N.C. to lay down basic tracks, then took a \"working vacation\" to Key West, to record vocals at Jimmy Buffett's Shrimpboat Sound. Additional overdubs took place in Atlanta and Nashville. \n\nThe result is the most expansive album Zac Brown Band has ever delivered, where the group's trademark vocal harmonies meet jaw-dropping musicianship in a musical world where genre boundaries are increasingly slippery. \n\nBut if you think that's going to mean reduced radio exposure and a shrinking audience, you don't know this band very well—or its audience. \"A lot of other artists may choose to sit back and do the same record they did last time, because they don't want to lose those fans,\" Fryar observes. \" But from our perspective, we think those fans deserve the best music we can make. If it's different from the past record that's OK, because it's the best we can do. And they deserve the best. They're paying our bills and feeding our families.\"\n\nAsked whether the band still feels at home on country radio, Hopkins notes that country radio has grown and evolved just as the band has. \"It's southern radio to me, and I don't think we're doing anything southern people wouldn't like.\"\t\n\n \"I love country radio because of the dedication they have given us,\" De Martini affirms. \"When I talk to program directors they tell me they're happy to play it, but they really have no choice because the fans are crazy about calling in and requesting our music all the time.\"\n\nThe album's two featured guests, Amos Lee and Trombone Shorty, aren't Music Row signifiers in the same way Alan Jackson was on 'You Get What You Give,' but Brown says this doesn't mean the band is leaving country music behind.  Far from it—lead single \"The Wind\" is \"the most country thing we've ever done,\" he notes. There is no \"master plan,\" he adds. \"We were just getting our buddies to sing with us.\"\n\nIn many ways Zac Brown Band is an unlikely success story. Bands who cover so much territory tend to become critics' darlings, but not platinum sellers. \n\n\"The two things I think that make this band different from anybody else, and the reason why we're here today, is that everybody has an insane work ethic,\" Bowles observes. \"Nobody complains. Everybody plays their asses off, everybody gets on the plane or bus even if they're not feeling well, and tries to do everything to the best of their ability, always. And Zac has this ability to make you believe what he's singing no matter what. So if we do an R&B tune or a reggae tune, he's totally believable. You believe he's lived 'Highway 20 Ride,' for example. His conviction comes through all those songs.\"\n\n \"One cool thing about Zac is that he loves to include everybody,\" De Martini adds. \"He doesn't really have to have the Zac Brown Band. I think he would be successful just as Zac Brown. But the band adds a lot and takes it to another level. It's one big family with him.\"\n\n","booking_agent":"CAA - 3310 West End Avenue, 5th Floor - Nashville, TN 37203 - jhuie@caa.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151602162188430","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/486751_10151602162188430_167676515_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Atlanta, Georgia","description":"Zac Brown Band is:\n\nZac Brown / Lead Vocals & Guitar\nJimmy De Martini / Violin, Vocals\nJohn Driskell Hopkins / Bass, Vocals\nCoy Bowles / Guitar, Organ\nClay Cook / Guitar, Organ, Mandolin, Pedal Steel, Vocals\nChris Fryar / Drums\nDaniel de los Reyes / Percussionist\n","general_manager":"ROAR - 9701 Wilshire Blvd. - 8th Floor - Beverly Hills, CA 90212 - zbb@roar.la","genre":"Southern Rock / Folk / Country ","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Atlanta, GA","influences":"A hybrid of rock, soul, country, bluegrass and reggae.","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":5382611,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/zacbrownband","name":"Zac Brown Band","press_contact":"Liz Norris - ROAR - norris@roar.la","record_label":"Southern Ground/Atlantic Recordings","talking_about_count":37304,"username":"zacbrownband","website":"http://www.zacbrownband.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Owl City","id":"65217182024","info":{"id":"65217182024","about":"The Midsummer Station, featuring the hit single \"Good Time\" w/ Carly Rae Jepsen, is available now on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/OwlCityTMSitunes ","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"Unwed Sailor, Stars of the Lid, Telefon Tel Aviv, Imogen Heap, Stairwell, DJ Encore, Prefuse 73, Rachel's, ATB, The Album Leaf, Helios, Sigur Rós, Boards of Canada, Hammock, Kazumi Totaka, Thomas Newman, Owen, Armin van Buuren","band_interests":"God, Optimism, Photography, Air Travel, Vegetarianism, Vintage Fashion, Australian Accents, Swimming Pools, Abstract Art, Wave Race 64, G-rated Movies, Pizza, Romance","band_members":"Adam Young","bio":"In November 2009, Owl City’s Adam Young, a native and longtime resident of Owatonna, Minnesota (pop. 25,000), who had made his very first airplane journey only a year prior at age 22, found himself standing on the Great Wall of China. “I called my mom on my cell phone at 2 a.m. Minnesota time and said, ‘You’ll never believe where I am right now!’” Young recalls with a laugh. “I’m this shy kid from nowhere. My family didn’t have a lot of money to take vacations, so for me to have that kind of experience was surreal.”\n\nIt was just one of many extraordinary moments this unassuming 24-year-old Midwesterner would have over the past 18 months thanks to the blockbuster success of Owl City’s major-label debut album — the lush, lovingly created Ocean Eyes, which was released by Universal Republic Records in July 2009. Filled with whimsical melodies and blissful beats that Young conjured up alone in the basement of his parents’ home in Owatonna, Ocean Eyes topped the Billboard Rock, Alternative, and Dance/Electronic charts and was certified gold or platinum in nine countries, including platinum in the U.S. The album spawned the quadruple-platinum first single “Fireflies,” which was a No. 1 smash hit in 24 countries including the U.S. (where it hit the top spot twice), and sold more than four million downloads. Its eye-popping success has made Owl City an international phenomenon, selling nearly 12 million tracks worldwide and amassing an impressive touring record, including support stints with Maroon 5 and John Mayer, and sold-out headlining tours in which Young, backed by a five-piece band, performed for besotted fans in the U.S., Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.\n\nYoung’s adventures over the past two years are evocatively detailed on the impossibly catchy electro-pop songs that make up Owl City’s new album, All Things Bright and Beautiful. “Ocean Eyes was written from the perspective of my bedroom,” Young says. “All I could do was imagine how I’d feel if I could visit all these places I was writing about. This time around, I was influenced by very specific things and was able to draw upon what I’d been through, so that got poured into the lyrics and the moods of the songs. The music always dictates the lyrics. I just sit down at the piano and think about things and it happens in front of me.” \n\nOn All Things Bright and Beautiful, the music and lyrics conspire to make listeners feel as if they were stepping into another world — a verdant musical dreamland where “reality is a lovely place, but I wouldn’t want to live there,” as Young sings on the opening track “The Real World.” Images of abundance, like a backyard of butterflies (“Honey and the Bee”), blossoms filling a room (“Hospital Flowers”), and “sunsets that dazzle in the dusk” (“Dreams Don’t Turn To Dust”) unfold alongside starry-eyed imaginings of cherry bombs staining blackbirds red (“Kamikaze”) and dipping one’s toes in the galaxy (“Alligator Sky”).\n\nYoung opens the album with “The Real World” because, for him, it serves as a partial commentary on his fanciful nature. “Not that I want to check out from what’s going on around me,” he explains, “but I’m the guy who’ll lie awake at night and have these wakeful dreams, like a movie director who’s creating this film in my head, and that is so inspiring. It’s worth more than anything that’s ever happened to me in person. So that song is kind of an embodiment of what life could be like if I were in a different place.” Interestingly, Young follows “The Real World” with “Deer in the Headlights,” a playful song about feeling the pressure to be the perfect guy. “It’s my way of telling myself, ‘Wake up, nothing will ever be that perfect.’ I put those songs back to back to say that you can stay in one world and be happy, but often what’s real is much different than what you perceive to be ideal.”  \n\nAnother highlight is the first single, “Alligator Sky,” which features Los Angeles rapper Shawn Chrystopher. “’Alligator’ and ‘sky’ are two words that don’t really go together, but conjure up an image, which fits the idea of the song,” Young says. “It’s about how there are so many weird things coming at you every day. Why not just meet them head on and take charge even though you have no say over what’s going to happen? You and those around you are what matter most.”\n\nThrough each song, even the more melancholy ones, such as “Dreams Don’t Turn To Dust” and “Plant Life” (on which Young sings about wishing plant life would grow all around him “so I won’t feel dead anymore”), Young retains his ever-present optimism, letting the listener know that no matter how tough times get, there’s always light at the end of the tunnel. “I would feel weird if I were to communicate anything other than optimism, because it’s just who I am,” Young says. “It's always been in me to make Owl City a vehicle that sends a hopeful message. As a listener, I'm drawn to things that are really uplifting. When a certain melody grabs my ear, it makes me feel like I could be a better person.” \n\nAll Things Bright and Beautiful also finds Young expanding his sonic palette, playing around with a harder-edged vocal delivery on “Kamikaze,” majestic strings on “Dreams Don’t Turn To Dust,” euphoric dancefloor tempo on “The Yacht Club” (featuring guest vocals by Canadian singer Lights), and straight-up piano pop on “Plant Life” (which Young wrote with Relient K’s Matthew Thiessen). The experimentation comes from Young’s evolving confidence as a songwriter, musician, producer, and engineer. As with Ocean Eyes, Young produced and engineered the album himself (before mixing it together with veteran mixer Jack Joseph Puig). “For the actual production of the album, tonality and texture played a larger part,” Young says. “I knew I wanted it sound bigger and be more dynamic than Ocean Eyes, so I put more time into trying to figure out how to do my job better from a technical standpoint. I had to polish up my knowledge so I could bring the sounds I heard in my head to life.”\n\nYoung has come a long way since his days posting his musical experiments on MySpace and YouTube, launching both an online savvy and radio-friendly career that the New York Times called “a textbook illustration of how the music business needs new and old forms of media to make an artist a star.” Before becoming an Internet sensation (racking up more than 98 million total plays on MySpace and more than 18.5 million channel views on Owl City’s Vevo/YouTube channel to date), Young, the only child of a mechanic and a schoolteacher, was attending community college and working dead-end jobs, including one in a warehouse loading Coca-Cola trucks. He began creating melodies and beats on his laptop as a way to combat insomnia and eventually self-released an EP, 2007’s Of June and an album, 2008’s Maybe I’m Dreaming, both of which reached the Top 20 on Billboard’s Electronic Albums chart. \n\nImpressed by Young’s connection to his grassroots audience, Universal Republic signed Owl City in early 2008 and stepped back to watch his creativity flourish. He has also released music under the moniker Sky Sailing, and appeared on a track on Dutch producer Armin van Buuren’s 2010 album Mirage. Last year, 300 and Watchmen and director Zack Snyder asked Young to write the theme song for his animated film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga-Hoole. “To The Sky” anchors the film’s soundtrack, which also includes the score by Academy Award nominee Davis Hirschfelder.  \n\nFor now, however, Young’s attention is focused on Owl City, which will hit the road for a U.S. tour in June 2011 following the May 17th release of All Things Bright and Beautiful. Forced to overcome his shyness and trepidation about performing live, Young is now enthusiastic about touring and showing up for his fans. “The gratification you get from flying across the world and playing to a sold-out room full of kids who know all your lyrics, even if they don’t speak your language, is incredible,” Young says. “It’s those times when you stand back and say, ‘I’m just a normal guy, I can’t believe this is happening.’”\n\n\n","booking_agent":"Creative Artists Agency","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151546869172025","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/524462_10151546869172025_406881687_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Owatonna, MN","general_manager":"Foundations Artist Management","genre":"Electronica/Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Owatonna, MN","influences":"Rachel Joy Scott, Audrey Hepburn, C.S.

Follow us on Twitter @TheBandPerry & http://instagram.com/thebandperry!","app_id":"0","band_members":"Kimberly Perry\nReid Perry\nNeil Perry","bio":"Kimberly Perry — lead vocals, guitar, piano / Reid Perry — bass, vocals / Neil Perry — mandolin, drums, accordion, vocals\n\nPioneer\n\nSince releasing their self-titled debut album in 2010, The Band Perry have ascended to dizzying heights. Fronted by Kimberly Perry and rounded out by her younger brothers Neil and Reid, the band has notched a string of hit singles, including the quadruple-platinum “If I Die Young” (which climbed to No. 1 on Billboard’s Country and AC charts), the platinum “You Lie,” and the Country No. 1 “All Your Life.” They’ve also enjoyed sold-out tours and a showering of honors, including multiple ACM, CMA, and CMT Music awards, as well as Grammy, Teen Choice, AMA, ACA, and Billboard Music award nominations — all of which has cemented the sibling trio as one of the hottest acts in recent history.   \n\nBut despite the validation that comes with such success, Kimberly, Reid, and Neil felt as if they were walking into the unknown when it came time to write and record their second album, which they’ve called Pioneer. “People hear the word ‘pioneer’ and they think of covered wagons or astronauts on the moon, but to us the idea of a pioneer is very modern,” Reid says. “It reflects the idea of putting one foot in front of the other when you’re unsure how to get where you’re going. It’s about marching forward and making noise.”\n\n“We had so many questions about our future, both personally and professionally,” Kimberly explains. “You can hear it in the lyrics to the song ‘Pioneer,’ which asks, ‘Where are we going?’ ‘What will become of us?’ After writing those lines, the song became our guiding light throughout the process of recording the album, which is why we chose it as the title track. It’s truly about the last three years of our lives and trusting that the songs we wrote would lead us where we were supposed to go. We also had to let go of fear and trust the boldness that has always informed our creative decisions.”\n\nThe boldness is clearly evident in everything from Pioneer’s album cover — with its bright red, grey, and black color scheme and the band’s confident leaning-forward stance — to the album’s fiery, rock and roll-influenced country sound. It’s the first recording the trio feels truly captures the full-throttle intensity of The Band Perry’s live show, which they attribute to the input of the album’s producer Dann Huff. Huff, a Nashville veteran who was mentored by Mutt Lange and has worked with Faith Hill, Keith Urban, and Rascal Flatts, is the first producer who insisted on seeing them in the band in its live element. \n\n“He was flabbergasted,” Kimberly recalls. “His mouth was hanging open. The first thing he said when we got off stage, was, ‘Whoa, you guys have a rock and roll edge. This is what you do.’ He had never heard it represented in our recorded music and he opened up our minds to that in the studio. That led us to add more electric guitars and background vocals, which created more daring musical moments. Dann threw out the rulebook and let us go anywhere we wanted.”\n\nThe result is a collection of country-rock stompers like “DONE.” (an empowerment anthem “about how you feel when you’ve given the best of yourself and it’s still not good enough,” Kimberly explains), the blistering “Night Gone Wasted,” and the Queen-influenced, punk-poppish “Forever Mine Nevermind.” There are also vulnerable, thoughtful tunes like “Pioneer,” “Mother Like Mine,” (an emotional tribute to the siblings’ parents, especially their mother), “Don’t Let Me Be Lonely,” “I Saw A Light,” and “End of Time,” a ballad that recalls the band’s Southern roots. \n\nThe trio’s love for Southern Gothic culture, including such authors as Flannery O’Connor and William Faulkner, is reflected on the platinum-selling first single “Better Dig Two” — a foreboding tale of a woman who makes a lifelong, somewhat unhinged commitment, while still wearing her heart on her sleeve. “The song expresses what we love about the deep South,” Kimberly says. “When you listen to the lullabies and fairy tales told in that part of the country, they feel a lot like the lyrics in this song.” (The platinum-selling “Better Dig Two,” which spent two consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Country chart, is The Band Perry’s fastest-rising single at radio ever, as well as their first No. 1 song in Canada.)  \n\nThen there’s “I’m A Keeper,” which Kimberly feels is very much her story. “I feel like I’m a free spirit first and foremost,” she says. “And the woman in this song has big plans, with or without a man. Maybe she’ll join the military, or maybe she’ll buy a house out on the prairie. All she knows is she has a big life ahead of her.” \n\nOne of the most meaningful songs to the band is “Back To Me Without You,” which was written in real time while Kimberly was dealing with the aftermath of a friendship that had imploded. “It was literally crashing and burning as we were writing the song,” Reid says. “She was heartbroken and had to take breaks from writing it in the front of the bus to go to the back of the bus to cry. Neil and I kept telling her, ‘Get back to what you know’ and ‘Get back to what you do,’ which ended up being lyrics in the song.” The track is just one example of how the band members raised the bar for themselves as songwriters on Pioneer. “We wrote every song on this album probably four times,” Neil explains. “Each time we’d finish, we’d ask ourselves, ‘Is this song completely honest about where we are in life? Does it say everything we want it to say?’\" \n\n“Our first album was an honest representation of where we were at the time,” Kimberly says. “When we sat down to write songs, we had pictures in our head, and back then it was very romantic imagery, like Ferris wheels at the county fair. This time our inspirational images were of armies and marching bands moving forward. It was very militaristic, and I think you can hear that in the melodies and the lyrics.” Adds Neil: “We didn’t discuss the images we had in our heads with each other at first. It was just what we all felt and how we processed the meaning behind the music.” \n\nTaken as a whole, Pioneer enables The Band Perry to accomplish one of its primary goals: to bring the romantic mystique of bands back to music — something they’ve dreamed of doing ever since forming the group in Mobile, Alabama, where the Perry kids moved with their parents after a childhood spent in Jackson, Mississippi. Kimberly started her first band at age 15, with ten-year-old Reid and eight-year-old Neil observing every rehearsal from the sidelines. “When the drummer and bassist would take a water break, they would jump on their instruments,” Kimberly recalls with a laugh. “They caught the fever immediately.” Reid and Neil started their own band, traveling with their family in a 36-foot motor home, playing modest shows in malls, campgrounds, and fairs. \n\n“Sometimes there’d be more people onstage than there were in out in the crowd,” Kimberly says. “But our parents, who had no legitimate experience in the music industry, said, ‘We’re not going to allow you to have a fallback plan. You were born to do music. We’ll support you, we’ll help you figure it out. This is what you need to do with your life.’ That was really the moment the three of us joined forces as The Band Perry. All the friends I had been playing with become interested in other things. I needed a band and Reid and Neil needed a lead singer.” Kimberly, Reid, and Neil spent the next ten years traveling, performing, and honing their skills before signing with Universal Republic in 2009 and being catapulted into the spotlight with “If I Die Young.” To this day, they are most comfortable onstage. “Just learning that craft made us feel comfortable when we started to book shows at the big arenas that we’re now getting to play,” Neil says.\n\nThe songs on Pioneer are tailor-made for arena shows. “We needed songs that could fill large spaces,” Kimberly says. “Our show is very aggressive; there are a lot of electric guitars and hard-hitting drums, and the music on Pioneer captures that.” “Playing the new songs has given our live show a new burst of energy and the crowd feels it, too,” Neil adds. “They’re as excited to have new music as we are.” \n","booking_agent":"For Booking information please contact: Rob Beckham at William Morris Endeavor Entertainment – 615.963.3337 ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151345683706016","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/7153_10151345683706016_1614299915_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"general_manager":"Bob Doyle & Associates","genre":"Country","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":1976703,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/thebandperry","name":"The Band Perry","press_contact":"Erin D.

This young singer is already considered by experts as the musical phenomenon of our times, due to his musical versatility and interpretive skills. This artist has consistently demonstrated a total dominance in most sub-genres of urban music (Reggaeton, Rap, Hip Hop, R & B and others), but has also prevailed in his forays into Pop, Bachata , Mambo, and Vallenato.\n\nIn a very short time, Farruko has transformed all of his songs in local and international successes. His songs have been leaked via social networks and Internet sites frequented by the American youth, achieving high levels of popularity.\n\nFarruko’s musical compositions simply reflect the concerns and feelings of young people by feeding the experience of their environment and his own. His lyrics can wander from adventures to win a girl, the challenge to talk to their parents, how to react when love unexpectedly comes up, or how to enjoy healthy and constructive fun with friends.\n\nIn 2011, Farruko introduced \"El Talento Del Bloque,\" his first solo album which contains 13 songs mostly composed by the artist himself. Highlights of the same include the collaborations of José Feliciano in \"Su Hija Me Gusta,\" Cosculluela in \"Ella No Es Facil,\" Arcangel y Voltio in \"Traime A Tu Amiga\", Yaga and Mackie in \"Por Medio Al Amor\", and Jadiel in \"Chuleria En Pote\". He also offered his fans hits like \"Hola Beba\", \"Hoy\", \"Cositas Que Haciamos,\" \"Romper La Discoteca,\" featuring Daddy Yankee and Yomo, and also participated in Daddy Yankee’s “Llegamos A La Disco Remix,” alongside other prominent artists of the urban genre.\n\n On May 22, 2012, Farruko released his second solo album entitled \"TMPR: THE MOST POWERFUL ROOKIE\", under the record labels, S & A Music Corp, Siente Music & Venemusic. The new official promotional track from this album is \"Feel the Rhythm,” where Farruko, once again demonstrates his ability in any genre, and now presents to the public a techno track with modern and popular influences, produced by Luny Tunes and Musicólogo.  Farruko is also working other alternative topics by popular demand, such as “Dime Que Hago,” Cositas Que Haciamos” & “Hola Beba (Mambo Version).\n\n\"TMPR\" The Most Powerful Rookie was nominated for Best Urban Album of 2012 in the prestigious music awards: \"The Latin Grammys,\" held on November 15, 2012 in Las Vegas, Nevada. \n\n\n\n\nFarruko, cuyo nombre de pila es Carlos Efrén Reyes Rosado, nació en Bayamón, Puerto Rico, el 2 de mayo del 1991. Este joven cantautor es considerado ya por los expertos como el fenómeno musical de estos tiempos, por su gran versatilidad musical e interpretativa. Este artista ha demostrado de manera contundente, su total dominio en la mayoría de los sub-géneros de la música urbana (Reguetón, Rap, Hip Hop, R&B y Otros), pero también ha salido airoso en sus incursiones en el Pop, la Bachata, el Mambo, y el Vallenato.\n\n \n\nEn corto tiempo, Farruko ha convertido todas sus canciones en éxitos locales e internacionales. Sus canciones se han filtrado a través de las redes sociales y sitios de Internet frecuentados por la juventud latinoamericana, logrando alcanzar altos niveles de popularidad.\n\n\nSu esencia musical y sus composiciones simplemente son el reflejo de las inquietudes y sentimientos de los jóvenes, alimentándose de la vivencia de su entorno y de las suyas propias. Sus líricas se pasean desde la aventura de conquistar a una chica, el reto de hablar con sus padres, como reaccionar cuando te llega el amor inesperadamente, hasta como divertirse sana y constructivamente con amistades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarruko nos presentó en el 2011 “El Talento del Bloque”, su primer álbum como solista el cual contiene 13 temas compuestos en su mayoría por el propio artista.

They won Metal Hammer’s 2006 “Golden God Award” for Best British Band, and the 2006 Kerrang! Award for “Best UK Single” for their track “Tears Don’t Fall.”  Here in America, Revolver magazine heralded the band “British Import of the Year,” and THE POISON generated the hit singles “Tears Don’t Fall” and “All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me),” with the video for “All These Things I Hate” going to the #1 spot on MTV2.  The band has toured North America three times, and in early 2007, they sold out their first headline trek.\n\nOn January 29, 2008, Bullet For My Valentine is set to return with SCREAM AIM FIRE (20-20/Jive/SonyBMG), the band’s highly anticipated sophomore release.  The 11-track assault was produced by Colin Richardson (Machine Head, Funeral For A Friend) and recorded at Sonic Ranch just outside of El Paso, TX in early 2007, and is, according to front man Matthew “Matt” Tuck, “really melodic heavy metal…catchy, hooky choruses and full-on vocals with the music being very in-your-face and heavy…it’s a lot more up-tempo than The Poison, a lot more aggressive.”  \n\nSCREAM AIM FIRE, featuring the distinctive and powerful six-string dexterity of Michael “Padge” Padget, the unwavering instrumental groove of bassist Jason “Jay” James and the relentless thundering rhythms of Michael “Moose” Thomas, the musical backbone of Bullet is an intimidating force.  With a lifetime of classic metal inspiration behind him, vocalist/guitarist Tuck is a formidable and powerful voice for the ever energetic, young metal generation.\n\n“We have stepped it up a gear,” says the front-man. “This album is chock full of classic Bullet ingredients. Metal riffs, pounding rhythms, shredding solos and great melodies. We took everything that we learnt from ‘The Poison,’ and took up tenfold. Better, fresher, harder, sadder and more real.”\n\nOpening with the aural assault of the title track and first single -“Scream Aim Fire” – to the hard-hitting riff slammer of “Waking The Demon,” and the arena-ballad epic “Hearts Burst Into Fire,” this album will definitely catapult Bullet into a world-wide spotlight. \n\n“(The track) ‘Scream Aim Fire’ set the benchmark for the rest of the album,” says Tuck. “It was the moment we realized the direction of where we wanted the record to go. Lyrically, it’s not a saying that anyone can relate anything else to. It’s ours and the meaning is ours alone. Kill or be killed – that’s what this game is like. You’re either on top of the game, or you are out, and we are very much still in. Our quality of song writing, our structures, our timing – the songs are intense and accessible, whilst still keeping our metal roots.”\n\nTuck believes that the band’s unique accessibility lies in the fact that fans – regardless of age, gender or nationality – can relate to the subjects and issues tackled within their tracks.\n \n“It’s important to us that fans can make a connection with our songs,” says the front-man. “For example, ‘Waking The Demon’ is about being bullied at school – which is something that me and most of the boys went though. The track is about one day, just turning round, and deciding to not take it anymore. I’d hope that our fans can relate to that.”\n\nAnd despite the fact that these four musicians are now considered prominent players in the UK/European metal world, as well as serious up-and-comers here in the U.S. – the lads remain grounded (all still living in their native Welsh homeland) – and eternally grateful for the position that they now find themselves in.\n\n“If it wasn’t for the fans, we would never even have been able to make this second album,” says Tuck. “We are so thankful to them, and we will always try to deliver the goods. I know we had to cancel a load of shows last year (Tuck was hospitalized in the winter of 2006 and forced to undergo surgery on his tonsils), but it hurt us so much to do so. We really hated to let anyone down, but it was an unavoidable evil, and now I am confident that this record – and this band – are stronger than ever.”\n\nTo support the release of SCREAM AIM FIRE, Bullet for My Valentine will set off on what will be more than two years of solid, worldwide touring, starting in the UK and Europe in January, 2008, and then coming to America beginning in late February. \n\n“We are still so hungry for this,” states Tuck. “We are motivated and ambitious. We know where we want to be.  We have played with legends and if we get to that level, it would be amazing. But you know what?  If it ended tomorrow, we would still be happy. We are amazingly proud of what we have achieved and what we have done. We are having the time of our lives. The world is our oyster…”\n\nScream, Aim, Fire – the bullets are launched. You have been warned!\n\n“Bullet For My Valentine seem unstoppable…”  -- NME\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151374820180505","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/12068_10151374820180505_945141660_n.jpg","offset_y":8,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Metal","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Bridgend, Wales","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":7542670,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/BulletForMyValentine","name":"Bullet for My Valentine","record_label":"Sony Music","talking_about_count":31405,"username":"BulletForMyValentine","website":"www.bulletformyvalentine.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Niall Horan","id":"177417169062990","info":{"id":"177417169062990","about":"Official Niall Horan Facebook Page.","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":4,"cover":{"cover_id":231992986938741,"source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/735187_231992986938741_925981466_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":2818301,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/Niallofficial","location":{"street":"","zip":"","latitude":41.12646311,"longitude":16.86108657},"name":"Niall Horan","talking_about_count":29270,"username":"Niallofficial","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Liam Payne","id":"352476444849191","info":{"id":"352476444849191","about":"Official Liam Payne Facebook Page.","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":410723562357812,"source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/246593_410723562357812_1226841046_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4006796,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/LiamPayne","name":"Liam Payne","talking_about_count":29230,"username":"LiamPayne","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Nicki Minaj","id":"112245142125072","info":{"id":"112245142125072","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"Nicki Minaj ist eine in den Vereinigten Staaten lebende Rapperin, R&B-Sängerin und Songwriterin.

El éxito de este tema ha sido innegable, de tal forma que en la actualidad su fuerza se ha acrecentado, aún y que la banda ha lanzado temas a la radio con buenísimos resultados.\n\nPosteriormente, y en un deseo de demostrar versatilidad y talento, la BANDA MS lanza al mercado el disco “CORRIDOS ATREVIDOS”, en el que la agrupación interpreta magistralmente uno de los géneros más polémicos de la música regional mexicana, en temas como “El M grande”, “Chuy y Mauricio”, “La raza contenta”, “Alfredo Beltrán”, “Está de parranda el jefe”, por mencionar tan sólo algunos de las 12 melodías incluidas. “El 24” es el sencillo que se promovió de este álbum.\n\nA finales del 2008, la BANDA SINALOENSE MS DE SERGIO LIZARRAGA lanzan su álbum “MI MAYOR ANHELO” del que desprenden el sencillo del mismo nombre, una balada de Alejandro Ojeda.

Biggie solidified his position with his classic 1994 debut album, \"READY TO DIE.\" Through the combination of Sean Combs' powerful production and B.I.G.'s vivid rhymes, the disc brought Bad Boy Records to the forefront of East Coast hip-hop and went to sell over four million copies. \n\nTragically, this superstar's life was cut short on March 9, 1997, when he fell victim to a shooting.

Feel as much like Ross as he does, and you become your own boss.” – The New Yorker\n \n“You can't listen to any station that plays hip-hop for an hour and not hear a Rick Ross song... he is at the very pinnacle of street. He has started to exhibit the signs of mainstream iconic status—appealing to the full spectrum …Three of his last four albums have debuted at no. 1 on the charts. If his new record, God Forgives, I Don't, doesn't follow suit, it will shock everyone in the music industry who knows anything.” - GQ \n\n“Believe it or not, it's been two years since Rick Ross's last solo album Teflon Don hit stores. Since then, his stature in the game has grown exponentially, with the growth of the Maybach Music Group brand, his epic Rich Forever mixtape-arguably the best rap album of 2012 so far-and a handful of stellar guest appearances.

The occasion: the announcement of a July 31st release date for the most-anticipated album of 2012, Ross’ long-awaited God Forgives, I Don’t. Ever the consummate business man and boss, Ross used the occasion to promote upcoming releases from his growing Maybach Music Group empire; Self-Made 2, the solo debut from Meek Mill, and more.\n \nThough his past four solo albums have debuted at #1, in the past year Ross’ stock has risen faster than ever. The arrival of his instant-classic mixtape ‘Rich Forever’ – a self-released behemouth that some are calling the best rap of the year thusfar – and the constant barrage of new material, features and online content that he and his MMG cohorts flood the streets with daily, has taken Ross to a new level.\n\"We believe that Rick Ross is among the elite; one of the most talented and compelling artists in the industry,\" said Def Jam Recordings president Joie Manda. \"He's done an amazing job of building his brand and image, and together with Def Jam's promotional muscle and marketing savvy, we intend to elevate Ross' stature across the board. It's an exciting time to be in the Rick Ross business.\"\n \n\"There's Jay-Z, Kanye, and Wayne—and Eminem is the king of his own domain,\" Rap Radar’s Elliott Wilson recently told GQ. \"And then there's Rick Ross, right on that cusp.\"\n \nNot content with the cusp, and thoroughly determined to dominate the conversation, Ross has bossed up and partnered with the superstar Usher for his new single “Touch’N You.” Released to radio and online yesterday, the Rico Love-produced banger is the lead single from ‘God Forgives,’ and sets the tone for what will be Ross’ most epic, most ambitious album to date.\n \n“Before I was ever in this position, I promised myself I would never take it for granted,” Ross told the expectant crowd gathered at his Manhattan press conference. “So that’s what I did with this project…it’s my best body of work yet. God Forgives, I Don’t is a very dark story…it’s extremely lyrical. The music is next level. I’m expecting nothing but the biggest results. That’s what’s needed, and I’m going to deliver”\n \nStay tuned for more on hip-hop’s biggest boss, Rick Ross, and the most-anticipated album of the year…God Forgives, I Don’t.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":478590895520921,"source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/46079_478590895520921_554291942_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Hip-Hop/Rap","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Miami, FL","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":4599875,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/rickross","name":"Rick Ross","record_label":"Def Jam Recordings/ Maybach Music Group","release_date":"7/31/2012","talking_about_count":24508,"username":"rickross","website":"rozayraw.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Ungu","id":"112143258802843","info":{"id":"112143258802843","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"Ungu adalah grup musik Indonesia yang beranggotakan Pasha (penyanyi), Makki (bass), Enda (gitar), Oncy (gitar), dan Rowman (drum).

Buy it on iTunes Here! http://smarturl.it/TripleFFFLife","app_id":"0","band_members":"Waka Flocka Flame","bio":"I never in my life wanted to rap. Let me quote that sh*t now.—Waka Flocka Flame on his 2009 debut mixtape, Salute Me or Shoot Me, Vol. 1 \n \nWaka Flocka Flame didn’t want to be a rapper when he grew up. He didn’t want to write hit songs, perform in front of thousands of people at packed clubs or hear his songs played on radio stations across the country. But more than a year after bursting onto the scene with his debut single, “O Let’s Do It,” the Atlanta rapper has managed to make more of an impact on the music industry than most rappers who have spent their entire lives trying to do it. And thanks to an influential cosign from fellow ATLien Gucci Mane, and a string of chart-topping singles, including the remix to “O Let’s Do It,” featuring Rick Ross and Diddy, and his latest hit, “Hard In Da Paint,” it doesn’t look like Waka Flocka is ready to quit rapping anytime soon.\n \n“I never dreamed I would be doing what I’m doing today,” says Waka, who earned his unique nickname from a cousin when he was younger while they were watching an episode of Jim Henson’s classic puppet show, The Muppet Show (he later added the “Flocka Flame” to the end of it at the suggestion of Gucci Mane). “I never imagined I’d become a rapper, let alone a successful rapper.” \n \nBorn Juaquin Malphurs in Queens, N.Y., Waka Flocka certainly had all the connections to forge into music at a young age. He grew up around the corner from Murda Inc. recording artist Ja Rule, lived near LL Cool J’s grandmother and even had a cousin who used to hang around the popular group Lost Boyz in the mid-1990s. But when his mother Debra Mizay—now the CEO of artist management group Mizay Entertainment—relocated the family to Riverdale, Georgia when Waka was 11, he shied away from music and instead focused on his love for basketball. And after his youngest brother died in automobile accident when Waka was just 14, he moved even further away from it, instead opting to spend his time running the streets of Atlanta with his friends. \n \n“That whole period of my life really messed with my head,” says Waka. “I ain’t even gonna lie—it killed me as a man. But it also made me stronger as a man in the future.” \n \nAt 18, Waka looked on as his mother began managing the career of Gucci Mane, who had established himself as a force to be reckoned with in Atlanta at the time by performing relentlessly throughout the South. Within two years, Waka began messing around with music himself alongside local producer Tay Beatz, who helped him shape his rambunctious personality on the microphone. “I was going through so much at the time,” says Waka. “I had so much stress and so many issues. I couldn’t release my emotions physically, so releasing them verbally was the only option I had.” \n \nThe result was Waka’s 2008 mixtape, Salute Me or Shoot Me, Vol. 1, featuring the trap anthem, “O Let’s Do It,” a song that caught on instantaneously in the A and quickly spread to other parts of the country. It allowed Waka to take his show on the road and also earned him a coveted slot in Gucci Mane’s 1017 Brick Squad clique. “Gucci and them were kind of shocked,” says Waka, “because nobody really knew I was rapping and then, all of a sudden, I had the biggest song in the South.” \n \nBut all the sudden success also took its toll on Waka. In January 2010, he was shot several times at a car wash in Atlanta during an alleged robbery attempt. The following month, legendary East Coast artist Method Man was doing an interview on satellite radio and spoke out against Waka, criticizing the lack of lyricism involved in crafting his style of music. He also endured a short rift in his relationship with Gucci Mane recently after the rapper parted ways with his mother’s management company in May. The incidents earned Waka a reputation as one of the most controversial artists in the industry—a reputation that he doesn’t feel he deserves. \n \n“People have definitely gotten the wrong impression of me so far,” says Waka. “I don’t know why they think I’m so controversial. I guess people just don’t know the real me yet. It’s up to me to change their minds.” \n \nHe’s spent the better part of 2010 doing exactly that. Earlier this summer, he released “Hard In Da Paint,” a catchy Lex Luger-produced track that inspired a slew of freestyles by other artists. He also put the finishing touches on his debut album, Flockaveli—the first released through So Icey/Asylum/Warner Bros. Records. Featuring the rowdy intro, “Bustin’ At ’Em,” the strip club anthem, “No Hands,” featuring Roscoe Dash and Wale, and the brutally-honest closing track, “Fuck This Industry,” it promises to be one of the most energetic debut albums of the year. \n \nBy naming it Flockaveli, Waka—who calls 2Pac his favorite rapper of all-time—is also doing more than just being controversial for the sake of being controversial. “2Pac introduced me to a guy named Machiavelli,” says Waka. “His back was always to the wall and people threw sticks and stones at him and he had to keeping blocking them. When I recorded this album, that’s how I felt.” \n \nAnd if anyone doesn’t like it? “I don’t care,” says Waka. “I’m just going to keep on making my music.” \n \nFor a guy who claims he never wanted to be a rapper, he’s certainly come around to the idea. \n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":466680960055792,"source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/14558_466680960055792_766102753_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"influences":"Kebo gotti , Capp, B Cezzy, P Cezzy, Pimpmode, Dreco, CJ, T.O.Green, Hit Man, D Moss, Puncho, Lil Stacy, and D PLUS the whole HST WOOH DA KID, FRENCHIE, Juice Man And GUCCIIII","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":6962709,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/wakaflocka","name":"Waka Flocka Flame","record_label":"1017 Brick Squad/Warner Bros.

The Eli Young Band—four musicians who met during their college days in Texas—is now 11 years into a career built on touring without a single lineup change. That dedication is paying off big-time as the band enjoys a crazy new level of success. They sell a crazy amount of tickets. Get a crazy amount of airplay. And are selling a crazy amount of downloads—EYB is on the verge of its first Gold single for the aptly named “Crazy Girl.”\n\nPenned by fellow artist Lee Brice and Nashville songwriter Liz Rose (“You Belong With Me”), “Crazy Girl” is a perfect introduction to Life At Best, a 14-track album that takes the band’s wide-ranging multi-genre influences and distills them into a focused, engaging vision: edgy country with hints of heartland rock bands such as Tom Petty and classic Eagles. \n\nProduced by Mike Wrucke with executive producer Frank Liddell (a team noted for its award-winning work with Miranda Lambert), Life At Best takes the listener on a journey, winding through songscapes that walk a delicate line. There’s a distinct variance from track to track as EYB veers from energetic quasi-rockers to steel-ladled country songs to conflicted ballads. And yet the album maintains a singular identity, built around a sound that’s been masterfully created over the course of three studio albums. \n\n“We were able to just go in and record the entire record all in the same time period, and so you’re in the same state of mind the entire time you’re recording,” lead singer Mike Eli notes. “There’s something to be said about that when you’re creating music, and I think this album demonstrates it. There’s a degree of cohesiveness with this record that I don’t think we’ve had with our prior records.”\n\nThere’s also a degree of anticipation—understandable given that “Crazy Girl” provides a new level of exposure to a national presence that’s been created by simple touring. Their last album, Jet Black & Jealous, debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard Country Albums chart in 2008 even though the group had never made the Top 10 through radio play at that point in its career. One title from that project, “Always The Love Songs,” provided that Top 10 breakthrough while the group earned critical acclaim from People, USA Today, Billboard, The New Yorker, American Songwriter and Country Weekly and picked up television appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. EYB also nabbed a nomination from the Academy of Country Music for Top New Vocal Group of the Year.\n\nStill, nothing demonstrated the band’s impact on the public consciousness better than its ability to turn a disappointing concert hurdle into personal triumph. A handful of dates on the multi-act Country Throwdown Tour were dropped in 2010 as the promoters made a cost-cutting move during a difficult touring season. With only nine days notice, the Eli Young Band announced a concert on its own in Dallas and sold an impressive 20,000 tickets with little advance.\n“We were rolling the dice on that show,” drummer Chris Thompson admits. “It was great to see the payoff on that concert and know that those people have our back.”\n\nIf the band’s fan base has its back, it’s merely an extension of the solidarity the Eli Young Band has demonstrated since the beginning. Thompson, guitarist James Young and bass player Jon Jones formed an instant friendship and started performing around Denton when they were students at North Texas State University in 1998. Eli came into the picture when he enrolled at the school the next year, first playing duo shows with Young, then singing lead as the gang of four officially made its live debut in October 2000.\n\n“In the very beginning, we decided that this is gonna be the four of us or it wasn’t gonna work,” Jones reflects. “Way before Nashville was even on our radar, we had time to figure out how we wanted to do it and really kind of commit to each other. We decided that we would be stronger, the four of us going through it together instead of just one person, which I think is the best thing about being a band. You have a group of people to share everything with—to share some of the work and keep each other grounded.”\n\nThere was plenty of work. And little pay. EYB built its reputation by honing its music in front of audiences. They’d play a club, sometimes for fewer than 100 members, but when they returned to that venue, the crowds were invariably larger. Within three visits, they usually sold out the house and would soon need to move up to a larger hall. \n\nThe group routinely plowed its earnings back into the business, buying better equipment, fueling its cramped van, and gambling on the good vibes the musicians shared as a band—and with their growing legion of fans. It’s the same method that lifted many classic bands: New Jersey’s Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Seattle’s Nirvana and Detroit’s Bob Seger. The Eli Young Band established itself first in Denton, grew to prominence in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, expanded into a regional act across Texas and Oklahoma and eventually extended its tentacles from coast to coast. \n\nEYB shed the van in favor of a bus several years ago and has stepped into even larger venues, opening for the likes of Alan Jackson, Jason Aldean and the Dave Matthews Band. And the group has reached a level where it regularly sells out 5,000-seaters on its own in the Southwest and 3,000-seaters in other areas of the nation.\n\n“Crazy Girl” underscored the strength of the group’s foundation when it sold 47,000 copies in its first week out. It quickly became the fastest radio hit in EYB’s career and sent an undisputable signal that the group is now a coast-to-coast phenomenon.\n\n“Some of the biggest responders were way outside of Texas,” Jones asserts. “It seemed like everywhere we’re went people were really welcoming us into the doors and ready to give the single a chance.”\nBut as strong a reception as “Crazy Girl” has received; it’s merely an introduction to an album long on ingratiating melodies, magnetic hooks and subtly provocative storylines. “Even If It Breaks Your Heart” kicks it off with a breezy Petty feel, and the project runs through the punchy “Every Other Memory,” the optimistic crunch of “Recover,” the introspective ballad “My Old Man’s Son” and the gritty “Skeletons.”\n\n“What I like about our records is there are different kinds of songs here and there, and there’s something for everybody,” Young says. “We don’t set out to write just one kind of song.”\n\nEYB members wrote or co-wrote nine of the 14 tracks, drawing on their collective experiences as musical partners and growing individuals. They referenced their struggles as a band, the pitfalls of relationships, the complexities of family heritage and the difficulties of simply being human. Despite digging into hardship, they transmitted it with an unerring sense of optimism. \n\nAnd they did it in a way that only four guys who have held together as friends and business partners through several years of difficult touring can. They were all born within a 15-month span, and that’s created a shared prism through which they’re able to see the world and their music.\n\n“Life At Best has just a little bit more maturity than anything we’ve done before,” Jones says. “We’re always writing about what we’re going through, and the type of song that appeals to us changes with our lives. We’ve been growing up together and going through the same phases really since college, and you can see some of that in this record.

A partir de entonces, ESPINOZA PAZ inicia un recorrido incansable en busca de su destino y regresa nuevamente a los Estados Unidos, esta vez a Oregon donde se desempeña como jardinero y después de un año, decide regresar a su tierra natal, ahora ya con la firme convicción de dedicarse a la música.\n\nDurante 8 años ESPINOZA PAZ se dedica a tocar puertas, cantando en bandas regionales, buscando oportunidades, sin dejar nunca de plasmar todos sus sentimientos y vivencias en sus canciones.\n\nNo obstante, el inicio de su mejor momento como compositor estaba por suceder cuando al mostrar sus canciones a “El Coyote”, éste le graba varias composiciones que se convierten en éxitos radiales, tales como “Besitos en el cuello”, “Prohibido” y \"Para impresionarte\", dejando de manifiesto su talento y poniendo el nombre de ESPINOZA PAZ en el interés de muchos otros artistas y grupos del ámbito regional mexicano. \n\nEn Diciembre del 2006, es durante la celebración de una boda que ESPINOZA PAZ conoce a Martin Fabian, quien, de inmediato reconoce el talento del joven canta-autor dando inicio a su carrera como cantante y haciendo los preparativos para su disco: \"El Cantautor del Pueblo\" que sale el año pasado y del que se desprendió el tema “El próximo viernes”, mismo con el que se encuentra nominado a los premios Billboard como “Tema Regional Masculino del Año”\n\nSin duda ESPINOZA PAZ es hoy por hoy uno de los compositor más consentidos de los grandes intérpretes de la música regional mexicana; sus temas se han escuchado ya en la voz de Jenni Rivera, Banda Cuisillos, El Coyote y su Banda Tierra Santa, Arrolladora Banda el Limón, Duelo, Sergio Veega, Montez de Durango y muchos más… Además, el joven compositor de 27 años ha sido el responsable de dar inicio a la popularidad de cantantes como “El Potro de Sinaloa”, Julio Chaidez y Adán Romero que gracias a la interpretación de distintas canciones de ESPINOZA ahora gozan de las mieles del éxito.\n\nEste éxito de ESPINOZA no sólo se ha visto reflejado en los grupos que han logrado vender miles de copias de sus discos y colocarse en los primeros lugares de popularidad en la radio de México y Estados Unidos; si no que para el mismo ESPINOZA le ha significado ganar varios reconocimientos por parte de los premios Billboard, premios BMI y Premios de la Radio como compositor del año por temas como “Para impresionarte”, “Mil Heridas, “Necesito Dueña”, “Te compro”, “Sobre mis pies”, entre otras…\n\nHace más de 10 años ESPINOZA prometió a su padre regresar a su pueblo natal de Campo General en Angostura, Sinaloa “para triunfar”; y sin duda lo está logrando, pues ya lleva un camino recorrido y un reconocimiento del público que no se consigue fácilmente… Pero ESPINOZA quiere más… Es por eso que ahora prueba suerte como cantante lanzando su segunda producción discográfica donde incluyó el tema “Madrecita Santa” en honor a su progenitora.\n\n“Ella nunca supo que yo escribía, pero siempre fue la primera en creer en mí y apoyarme”, cuenta ESPINOZA sobre su madre.\n\nSu segundo disco que saldrá a la venta a finales del mes de mayo, llevará por título “Yo no canto, PERO LO INTENTAMOS” del cual se desprende el sencillo “Lo Intentamos” y que a la semana de su lanzamiento se colocó en el Top40 de Billboard. En dicho disco escucharemos temas completamente nuevos, autoría del mismo ESPINOZA y entre los que se encuentran lo mismo temas rítmicos, que cumbias y rancheras, además de canciones románticas que seguramente llegarán al corazón de todos los enamorados y que simplemente demuestran el gran talento que posee ESPINOZA PAZ. \n\n","booking_agent":"Nueva Generacion

Al mismo tiempo, el argentino Noel Schajris debutó en 1992 como solista y luego ocho años más tarde con su álbum debut Cita en las nubes en 1999. Siendo ambos músicos, compositores y cantantes, en el año 1999 descubrieron la fórmula ideal para unir sus talentos y personalidades. Noel: \"Cuando tuvimos nuestra primera reunión para formar Sin Bandera, hubo química inmediata. Hablamos sobre nuestra música favorita, de los últimos discos que habíamos comprado, de los cantautores que más nos llegaban y coincidimos en todo\". Leonel: \"Además, a los dos nos gusta cantar, pero Noel prefiere el piano y yo la guitarra, por lo que en ningún momento hubo choque de intereses, sino una integración de gustos musicales. De hecho en la primera reunión que hicimos para empezar a planear el disco, hicimos tres canciones ¡en un día!, incluso algunas de ellas son parte del disco\".","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":1404962,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sin-Bandera/107872959241180","name":"Sin Bandera","talking_about_count":17884,"website":"http://NoelSchajris.com, http://LeonelGarcía.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Jenni Rivera","id":"22511018923","info":{"id":"22511018923","about":"Nuevo Album: \"La Misma Gran Señora\" disponible En: iTunes https://t.co/GCuHmsCD","app_id":"0","bio":"Jenni Rivera, es sin duda la líder femenina dentro del género Regional Mexicano, una figura importante dentro de un género en donde el hombre ha predominado. La ganadora de varios discos de ORO y PLATINO Certificados por RIAA, nos brinda sus más reciente producción musical titulada “JENNI” y estará disponible en todas las tiendas el 9 de septiembre, 2008.\n\nEl primer sencillo en promoción se titula, ‘Culpable o Inocente’ de la autoría de Camilo Blanes, el cual fue popularizado por la actriz y cantante, Lucia Méndez en los años 80’s. Dicho tema fue grabado en versión banda y pop con el estilo único de ‘La Diva’. Como sus hits anteriores, indudablemente ‘Jenni’, de nueva cuenta convertirá ‘Culpable o Inocente’ en un éxito radial.\n\nEn esta producción Jenni Rivera, decide producir su propio álbum para darse a conocer como la mujer que es, no como la artista que todos conocen. “Este disco quise producirlo en su totalidad yo misma, porque deseaba tener una producción en el cual se me conociera no como artista ni como figura publica, si no, como lo que soy, una mujer. Al final de cuentas, solo eso soy, una mujer como cualquier otra...\"Con dudas y soluciones, con defectos y virtudes, con amor y desamor....suave como gaviota, pero felina como una leona\".....orgullosamente....soy parte de ese \"fuerte, sexo débil\". A través de este disco titulado simplemente \" JENNI\", quise transmitir los sentimientos de lo que \"JENNI\" es.....simplemente una mujer. Desde las fotografías hasta la letra de cada canción....esto es \"JENNI\", comento ‘La Diva’.\n\n“Jenni” cuenta con 12 espectaculares temas, y un bonus track, de los cuales cuatro son de la autoría de ‘La Diva’.Con esta producción, Jenni Rivera, nos ofrece temas que para ella tienen un gran significado, además temas inéditos escogidos por la interprete, con mensajes de amor y desamor y con dedicaciones especiales.\n\nLos temas que contiene esta magnifica producción son: “Chuper Amigos”, “Culpable O Inocente”, Envuélvete”, “Tu Camisa Puesta”, “Ni Me Viene Ni Me Va”, “Con El”, “Cuando Me Acuerdo De Ti”, “Fraude”, “Trono Caído”, “Vale La Pena”, “La Cama”, y “Mudanzas”.\n\nA través de su carrera ‘la Diva de la Banda,’ ha gozado de una legión de fieles admiradores los cuales se componen de una audiencia multi generacional que admira su talento e integridad musical.\n\nCon una discografía de más de una decena de álbumes lo cual puede sonar fácil de cumplir, no obstante para Jenni Rivera, esto significa una labor de amor, esfuerzo y sobre todo, múltiples sacrificios. Y de costumbre todo lo que ella hace, lo hace pensando en dar lo mejor de si misma y su música.

A Banda Calypso – que celebra agora essa marca com o lançamento de um CD duplo e um DVD – é um fenômeno em si. Decifrá-la é entender um pouco mais sobre os novos rumos do mercado e também mergulhar num vasto universo paralelo que o Brasil muitas vezes finge desconhecer: ele mesmo.\n\nCriação da vocalista Joelma e seu marido, o brilhante guitarrista Chimbinha, a Calypso nasceu em Belém do Pará – mas não em berço esplêndido. Longe demais das capitais e perto demais das fronteiras de exclusão do país, ela teve que dançar conforme a sua música – uma apimentada mistura de ritmos caribenhos e nacionais, como lambada, guitarrada e carimbó – para ganhar uma vaga ao Sol. E fez isso com a postura de uma banda independente – tão “indie” quanto qualquer banda de rock do sul do país.\n\nSem gravadora, mas com boa música para dar e vender, Joelma e Chimbinha construíram, eles mesmos, a ponte entre banda e público, deixando seus CDs nos mercados populares da cidade, a preço de custo, para que se tornassem conhecidos. Assim, sem saber, a banda estava prestes a se tornar um modelo de fazer negócios sem depender de terceiros, e também na forma de lidar com os downloads e a pirataria, a ponto de ser citada como exemplo pela revista americana “Wired”.\n\n– No início foi complicado mesmo – conta Joelma. – Deixamos nossos discos com os camelôs por necessidade. Só que isso foi se multiplicando, nos dando uma fama no boca a boca. No final das contas, foi o público que carregou a gente nos braços.\n\nMais de dez milhões de discos vendidos depois fica claro que essa estratégia deu muito certo. A Calypso hoje tem ônibus e caminhões, moram em Recife e São Paulo, possuem um estúdio na cidade de Recife, fazenda no Pará e um staff de 40 pessoas, entre técnicos, músicos, dançarinos e assessores. E tem, cereja no bolo, mais de 250 fã-clubes pelo país e quatro no exterior. Isso para não falar, já falando, da TV Calypso, pela Internet (www.tvcalypso.com.br), com trechos de shows, agenda, bastidores, entrevistas…\n\n– Depois desses dez anos, isso tudo representa uma grande vitória para a gente e, acima de tudo, para o som que a Calypso representa – conta Chimbinha. – No começo, era difícil para rádios e casas noturnas do Pará nos receberem. Hoje, somos tocados em rádios de todo o Brasil e recebidos em casas noturnas das principais capitais. É um sonho.\n\nPara celebrar sonhos, nada melhor do que doses musicais de realidade, comprimidas nos dois CDs (2010) (com 26 músicas no total) e no DVD que marcam essa trajetória.\n\n– Foi bem complicado escolher as músicas para esses discos, já que temos muitas que representam diversos momentos da história da Calypso – afirma Joelma. – Com o coração apertado, chegamos a essa seleção, que contou também com a participação dos nossos fã-clubes.\n\nNo DVD, a banda aparece como ela é: uma cantora carismática, um guitarrista exuberante, uma precisa banda de apoio e um espetáculo que nunca resvala na vulgaridade. A banda Calypso é pop e mostra, com toda a sua exuberância, o lado B que o Brasil muitas vezes finge desconhecer.\n\n– O DVD tem participação do Fagner e de Bruno & Marrone.

This \"garage band\" from Topeka was discovered by Wally Gold, who worked for Don Kirshner, and released their first album in 1974.\n\nThe band has produced eight gold albums, three sextuple-Platinum albums (Leftoverture, Point of Know Return, Best of), one platinum live album (Two for the Show) and a million-selling gold single, ‘Dust in the Wind.’ KANSAS appeared on the Billboard charts for over 200 weeks throughout the ‘70's and ‘80's and played to sold-out arenas and stadiums throughout North America, Europe and Japan. \n\nIn 1998, KANSAS released an orchestral album, \"Always Never the Same\" recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. They followed with an orchestral tour accompanied by top-caliber symphony orchestras.\n\nIn 2000 KANSAS went back into the studio with original band member and songwriter Kerry Livgren to produce \"Somewhere to Elsewhere,\" the first album featuring all 6 of the original players in 20 years! The ten new songs were written by Kerry Livgren and recorded in his studio in Topeka, KS. Players included: Phil Ehart, Billy Greer, Dave Hope, Kerry Livgren, Robby Steinhardt, Steve Walsh and Richard Williams.\n\nKANSAS in 2002, released a state-of-the-art DVD using the latest technology in film, audio and visual design, entitled “Device-Voice-Drum.” The DVD was the driving force behind the 2002/2003 tour.  \n\nSony Music released a boxed set in 2004 titled \"Sail On\" which featured unique KANSAS cuts as well as vintage video footage on the included DVD disc.\n\nIn 2006, Kansas, released the two-disc (one CD/one DVD) anthology “Works In Progress.” Material was taken from a decade's worth of studio and live albums and home videos -- 1992's 'Live At The Whisky,' 1995's 'Freaks Of Nature,' 1998's 'Always Never The Same' and 2002's 'Device Voice Drum. \n\nIn 2009, in their hometown of Topeka, KANSAS celebrated their 35th Anniversary with a symphonic concert, accompanied by the Washburn University Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Larry Baird. The DVD release “There's Know Place Like Home” captured this unique live performance and featured special guests Kerry Livgren &amp; Steve Morse.  Available on both DVD and Blu-Ray, “There’s Know Place Like Home” includes favorites such as ‘Dust In The Wind,’ ‘Carry On Wayward Son’ and ‘Point of Know Return’ as well as a sampling from each album in their discography, with a special symphonic touch. \n\nInspired by their 35th Anniversary DVD “There’s Know Place Like Home,” in 2010 KANSAS began their ‘Collegiate Symphony Tour’ performing their hits accompanied by various college and university symphonies throughout the United States to help raise funds and awareness for collegiate music programs.  In 2011, this tour lead to a special collaboration with the US Army Orchestra culminating in the ‘Carry On Concert’ honoring America’s veterans on Veteran’s Day 11/11/11 at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, DC.\n\nThe band, which is currently comprised of drummer Phil Ehart, bassist Billy Greer, violinist David Ragsdale, singer/keyboardist Steve Walsh, and guitarist Richard Williams, will continued their ‘Collegiate Symphony Tour’ through the spring of 2012.  \n\nAlong with touring, KANSAS continues to remain a fixture of Classic Rock radio and has reached a whole new audience through their unmistakable presence on the popular video games Rock Band and Guitar Hero, and through their songs inclusion in various television shows such as ‘Supernatural,’ and ‘South Park,’ and with films ‘Old School,’ and ‘Anchorman.’ ","booking_agent":"CAA - Jeff Hill - jeff.hill@caa.com (United States) - Randy Salcedo - rsalcedo@caa.com (International)","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151185030906006","source":"http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/400133_10151185030906006_2123264351_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"description":"Up to date news and information is posted on this page, however, the band members themselves do not post to this page.\n\nAny photos or comments you post to this page become property of the band for potential future use.","general_manager":"Phil Ehart","genre":"Classic Rock/Progressive Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Kansas","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":510298,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/KansasBand","name":"Kansas","press_contact":"KANSAS Management Office - J.R.

And they're already legends, with a secure place in history and a plaque at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. But THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND is also a vital contemporary phenomenon, as much a part of the present and future of music as any band can be.\n\nIn early 2003, the group released the critically lauded Hittin' The Note, their first new studio project in nine years (and 24th overall). Released March 18, 2003 on their own Peach label (via a new deal with Sanctuary), these 11 tracks prove the band's ability to adapt its classic sound to the energy and aesthetics of modern rock. The ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND underlined the success of Hittin’ The Note (including two Grammy nominations for the track “Instrumental Illness”) with a live DVD and CD recorded in New York during the group’s annual marathon of shows at the Beacon Theatre (which they have packed over 140 times, including 14 sell-outs in 2006). The group also continues to release music from their personal archives, which they’ve guarded closely over the years.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band at the Beacon Theatre…just hearing the phrase conjures up images and sounds of well executed and passionately played live rock and roll. To capture the event for fans who might not necessarily have been lucky enough to get into the 2894-seat venue, the group recorded the shows, and released the Live At The2 Beacon Theatre DVD in late ’03, and it was quickly certified gold. One Way Out, a live album from the same Beacon stand, came out in March 2004.\n\n2003 also brought further accolades for the ALLMANS. The band was recognized by Rolling Stone for featuring four of the top 100 guitarists of all time: the late Duane Allman was cited as #2, while current guitarists Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks came in at #23 and #81, respectively. Known as one of rock’s best live acts, the ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND were one of only two artists whose live albums ranked in the top 50 of Rolling Stone’s list of the “500 Greatest Albums of All Time.” The ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND was honored for At Fillmore East (while James Brown was saluted for Live At The Apollo). An expanded version of At Fillmore East and the previously unavailable Atlanta International Pop Festival (the July 1970 concert that they both opened and closed) were released to critical and fan acclaim. The group was selected as the first artist to introduce the “Instant Live” program, whereby fans were able to purchase CD copies of the ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND concert they just saw, immediately after the show.\n\nNot many groups have been around as long as The Allman Brothers Band. Of those that have, most have either lapsed into a nostalgia-act coma or withered on a weary vine. If you're talking about a band that has both legs and heart, whose experience feeds an intensity that's rare even among the greenest music newbies, that narrows the field pretty much down to these psychedelic sons of the South. But passion doesn't come easily, which helps explain why it's taken them so long to record once again. In April 1997, frustrated by tensions within the group that were threatening to slow its creative momentum, Warren Haynes and bassist Allen Woody left to pursue Gov’t Mule (with whom he still tours and releases new music), and the focus of the group shifted exclusively to live performance. Though they still delivered killer shows, something was missing, and eventually it became clear that the only way to get it back was to make a change in the personnel.\n\nThe Brothers had been in this place before; most recently it had expanded its\nimprovisational range by bringing a fresh face, 21-year-old Derek Trucks, into the\nlineup, with a solo style that mingled elements of Southern rock, bluesy slide guitar, and free-form jazz. In September 2000, after the departure of longtime guitarist Dickey Betts, they reached this time into their past by inviting Haynes to come back. It was a poignant moment for all concerned, as Allen Woody's passing had suddenly put Gov’t Mule on hold.\n\nSitting in with the Allman Brothers Band in 2001, during their annual concert series at New York's Beacon Theatre, Haynes slid easily into his old role, trading licks and\ncruising through the group's trademark twin-guitar passages, paired for the first time with Trucks. That's all it took to convince the band to start laying down tracks again. \"Everybody was itching to get back into the studio,\" Haynes says. \"We all wanted to break some new ground, and at the same time we wanted to maintain the Allman Brothers Band. Of course, that's not difficult with this band, but with all the new blood and excitement about making a new record, we found ourselves exploring a lot of new territory. The chemistry between me and Derek very quickly reached a telepathic level, and I think Gregg started singing better than he has since the '70s.\" More critically, a rush of new songs accelerated the band's momentum. \"Gregg and I started writing, and everything fell into place, even more so than in the past,\" Haynes says. \"The first song we wrote this time out was 'Desdemona,' and it was such a high water mark that we were like, 'Okay, now we've got to compete with that in every song we write.'\"\n\nThey kept to that standard on all the original titles recorded for Hittin' The Note. (The album also includes two covers, Freddy King's \"Woman Across the River\" and the Rolling Stones' \"Heart Of Stone,\" along with \"Rockin' Horse,\" which Allman, Haynes, Woody, and Jack Pearson co-wrote in 1994.) In settings that range from the intimate acoustic guitar duo \"Old Friends\" to the turbulent long-form (and Grammy-nominated) jam \"Instrumental Illness,\" Hittin' The Note proves that this band is bigger than any era through which it has passed, as strong as any of the many acts it has inspired, with a lot more history still to be made.\n\n\"Things have changed in a good way,\" Gregg Allman muses. \"They say everything\nhappens for the best, and you wonder why at the time, but then in the long run you see why. Someone will go, and that's a real drag, but then somebody else comes in who adds so much more than you even expected. With the people we've got now, as long as we just keep playing without any gimmicks or cutting any corners, I guess we'll be around for a long time more.\"\n\nThe Story So Far Allman knows better than most in this business how long a \"long time\" can be. In fact, his band, with its mix of down-home groove and instrumental virtuosity, blues-drenched soul and guitar-driven rock, and dedication to all-night jamming, laid the groundwork for what became known as the Southern Rock movement. You can date it from March 1969, when Florida-raised guitarist Duane Allman left Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he'd established himself as an in-demand session player on recordings by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, King Curtis and Boz Scaggs, among others. Seeking to form his own dream band, Allman recruited bassist Berry Oakley and guitarist Dickey Betts from a Jacksonville, Florida band called the Second Coming.\n\nHe also tapped not one but two drummers: the R&B veteran Jaimoe (then known as Jai Johanny Johanson), who had worked with Otis Redding, Joe Tex, and Percy Sledge, and Butch Trucks, late of a Jacksonville folk-rock group, the 31st Of February. Hammond B-3 organist and lead vocalist Gregg Allman had recorded two albums with brother Duane as part of the L.A.-based Hourglass, and was developing into one of the finest white blues singers of all time.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band's sonic trademarks were all in place by the time their selftitled debut album was released in 1969 (see discography below). Driven by the relentless propulsion of Jaimoe and Butch, Gregg's bluesy keyboard comping, and Berry's deep, melodic bass lines, Duane Allman and Dickey Betts crafted a unique twin lead guitar approach that took its cues from jazz horn players (particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane) as well as the harmonized fiddle lines of Western swing and bluegrass. Together, they rewrote the rulebook on how rock guitarists could play together, and paved the way for every two- and even three-guitar band that would follow their path.\n\n\"Most fans had never heard anything quite like the mercurial solos and meticulous\ncounterpoint effortlessly unreeled by Duane Allman and Betts,\" wrote author Joe Nick Patoski in The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll (1992, Random House). \"In many respects, indeed, the Allman Brothers Band had become one of the most impressive bands in the country.\"\n\nOn their first four recordings -- The Allman Brothers Band, Idlewild South, At The\nFillmore East, and Eat A Peach -- the ABB perfected a sound that effortlessly combined rock, blues, country, and jazz on such unforgettable original tunes as \"Dreams,\" \"Revival,\" \"Midnight Rider,\" \"Melissa\" and \"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed.\" By 1971, they were poised for superstardom. Even the tragic deaths of both Duane Allman (on October 29, 1971) and bassist Berry Oakley (on November 11, 1972) in eerily similar motorcycle accidents couldn't stop the band's upward trajectory.\n\nThe success of the No. 2 Pop single \"Ramblin' Man\" triggered a mid-Seventies run (with the four surviving original members joined by bassist Lamar Williams and keyboardist Chuck Leavell) that ended only when internal conflicts sundered the group in 1976. A third incarnation of the ABB was formed in 1978 for the album Enlightened Rogues, but after two further albums, the group disbanded once again. Yet the pull of their roots proved too strong for the Brothers to remain apart. In the summer of 1989, the Allman Brothers Band launched a 20th Anniversary Tour with Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Butch Trucks, and Jaimoe, complemented by slide guitarist Warren Haynes and bassist Allen Woody. (Percussionist Marc Quiñones joined in 1991.) Signed to Epic Records, the new lineup returned to the recording studio with producer Tom Dowd for three studio albums and two live sets. (Dowd, a legendary producer and engineer, manned the controls for Idlewild South, At Fillmore East, Eat A Peach, and Enlightened Rogues.) Of the ABB's Epic label debut Seven Turns, The New Yorker wrote, \"The Brothers play with the energy of teenagers and the ornery wildness of veteran blues men.\"\n\nIn an increasingly predictable world of prefabricated pop, the ABB's peerless\nmusicianship and extravagant flights of improvisation earned the group a new audience- -one that transcended generational and regional boundaries. In October 1989, the Allman Brothers Band headlined the Beacon Theater in New York City for four nights, inaugurating a live performance tradition of multi-night stands that persists to the present. Their lengthy annual tours grew to include long stops in major cities, featuring ever-changing set lists: six shows at New York's Radio City Music Hall and five nights at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia, as well as multiple nights at the Wiltern in Los Angeles, the Warfield in San Francisco, Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, the Orpheum in Boston and the Fox Theater in Atlanta, among others. 1994 was a banner year, though not an untypical one, in the recent history of the Allman Brothers Band. The group made five live network television appearances; played 90 live dates, including the H.O.R.D.E tour, which they headlined; turned in one of the best, most exciting sets of Woodstock '94; and was voted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. \"In terms of sheer creativity, they're experiencing the\nstrongest second wind of any act,\" noted The New York Daily News. \"For sheer soloing ability, not only do the Allman Brothers run circles around anyone of the present generation, they outperform anyone of their own…Their road deserves to go on forever.\"\n\nAt the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, held in February 1996, the Allman Brothers Band won the first Grammy in its 27-year history: Best Rock Instrumental Performance, for \"Jessica,\" a track from the acclaimed live album 2nd Set. This 16-minute improvisation may be the longest single non-classical performance ever to win a Grammy. (Another track from 2nd Set, \"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed,\" was also nominated in the Pop Instrumental category.)\n\nIn the spring of 1997, when Haynes and Woody left to pursue Gov’t Mule, they were replaced by Oteil Burbridge on bass and Jack Pearson on guitar. Acclaimed by critics and fans alike as the rising star of electric bass, Burbridge also performs with his own band, the Peacemakers (who released their second album Believer in 2005, and on occasional reunion shows by his former group, Aquarium Rescue Unit. (In September 2000, weeks after Woody's death at age 44, the Brothers organized and performed \"One For Woody,\" an all-star benefit concert at Roseland Ballroom in New York. The evening featured more than five hours of music by the Allman Brothers Band, Phil Lesh & Friends, the Black Crowes, Warren and Matt of Gov’t Mule, and friends Little Milton, Leslie West, and Edwin McCain.) Tennessee’s Jack Pearson continues to do session work in Nashville and performs live with his Jack Pearson Band. He is known to occasionally make guest appearances at the Brothers’ concerts.\n\nIn June 1998, Epic Records released Mycology: An Anthology, featuring eight tracks culled from the Brothers' Epic catalog: \"Good Clean Fun\" and \"Seven Turns\" from Seven Turns; \"End Of the Line\" and \"Get On With Your Life\" from Shades Of Two Worlds (1991); \"Nobody Knows\" from An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band (1992); \"Sailin' Cross The Devil's Sea\" from 2nd Set (1995); and \"No One To Run With\" and \"Back Where It All Begins,\" from Where It All Begins (released 1994, certified gold in November 1997). In addition, Mycology includes two bonus tracks: a live acoustic version of \"Midnight Rider\" from the limited-edition benefit CD for the Rhett's Syndrome Foundation; and a previously unreleased version of \"Every Hungry Woman,\" recorded live at the 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival by the original lineup of the Allman Brothers Band.\n\nIn June of 1999 Derek Trucks made his debut on guitar, replacing Jack Pearson as colead and slide guitarist. Just 21 years old at the time, the gifted young player is the nephew of drummer and founding band member Butch Trucks. When not on the road with the ABB, he tours tirelessly with his own Derek Trucks Band, which has released albums (The Derek Trucks Band, Out Of The Madness, Joyful Noise; Soul Serenade; Live @ the Georgia Theater, and Songlines). He has also toured as a member of Phil Lesh & Friends and recorded with Gregg Allman, Gatemouth Brown, Johnny Copeland, and Junior Wells. Onstage, he's sat in with Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, and wife Susan Tedeschi, to name a few. Derek Trucks' epochal debut with the band was captured on Peakin' At The Beacon, a live set released by Epic in 2001. That same year, the Brothers announced that guitarist Dickey Betts would be replaced With Haynes' return to the group, the seed was planted for the band's triumphant return to the studio for the Hittin' The Note sessions.\n\nSince 1989 the Brothers have toured nationally every year, averaging more than 60 live shows per year. The tradition continues in 2006, with 14 nights of \"March Madness\" at New York City’s Beacon Theatre from March 9 through 26. …all of which leaves little unsaid about this incomparable band. Leave it to another\ntranscendent artist, Willie Nelson, to wrap up the essence of the Allman Brothers Band, as he did while presiding over their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: \"The Allman Brothers Band took what moved them and merged it into something unique that audiences love: a sound that redefined the direction of rock & roll, and opened the doors to a spirit of experimentation that continues in today's music. \"The Allman Brothers Band were and still are one of the most exciting live bands ever to hit the stage. They became road warriors with a vengeance and left devoted fans wherever they went…[The ABB is] a band that reflects so many of my sentiments about music: originality, a determination not to be confined musically or stylistically, but instead to forge your own way and make music that moves you, a devotion to the road, and understanding that beyond pleasing yourself as an artist, the only other consideration should be the people, the fans who come to hear you. \"And so, with pleasure, I give you rock & roll's greatest jammin' blues band, the Allman\n\nBrothers Band!\"\nTHE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND\nA SELECTED ALBUM DISCOGRAPHY\nTitle Label Year\nThe Allman Brothers Band Mercury 1969\n7\nIdlewild South Mercury 1970\nAt Fillmore East Mercury (2-LP) 1971\nEat A Peach Mercury (2-LP) 1972\nBrothers & Sisters Mercury 1973\nWin, Lose, Or Draw Mercury 1975\nThe Road Goes On Forever (anthology) Mercury (2-LP) 1975\nWipe The Windows, Check The Oil, Dollar Gas Mercury (2-LP) 1976\nEnlightened Rogues Mercury 1979\nReach For The Sky Arista 1980\nBrothers Of The Road Arista 1981\nDreams (anthology) Mercury (4-CD box set) 1989\nLudlow Garage (live) Mercury (2-CD set) 1990\nSeven Turns Epic 1990\nA Decade Of Hits (anthology) Mercury 1991\nShades Of Two Worlds Epic 1991\nAn Evening With … (live) Epic 1992\nLive At Great Woods (home video) Epic 1993\nA Decade Of Hits Polydor 1994\nWhere It All Begins Epic 1994\nHell & High Water (best of Arista years) Arista 1994\n2nd Set (live) Epic 1995\nMycology: An Anthology Epic 1998\nPeakin' At The Beacon (live) Epic 2000\nAmerican University 12/13/70 (live) Allman Brothers Band 2002\nRecording Company\nHittin' The Note Peach Records/Sanctuary 2003\nStonybrook 9/19/71 (live) ABBRC 2003\nLive At The Beacon Theatre (dvd) Peach/Sanctuary 2003\nAtlanta International Pop Festival (live) Sony Legacy 2003\nOne Way Out (live) Peach/Sanctuary 2004 (3/23)\nMacon City Auditorium 2/11/72 (live) ABBRC 2004\nStand Back (compilation) UTV 2004\nNassau Coliseum 5/1/73 (live) ABBRC 2005\nwww.allmanbrothersband.com","booking_agent":"Podell Talent Agency http://www.podelltalent.com/","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151145901718917","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/539250_10151145901718917_2017253072_n.png","offset_y":104,"offset_x":0},"description":"Welcome to the official Allman Brothers Band page on Facebook!","genre":"Rock, Blues, Jam Band","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Macon, Georgia","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":569849,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/allmanbrothersband","name":"Allman Brothers Band","record_label":"Peach and ABB Recording","talking_about_count":12357,"username":"allmanbrothersband","website":"http://www.allmanbrothersband.com http://www.ticketmaster.com/Allman-Brothers-Band-tickets/artist/734412","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda La Trakalosa de Monterrey","id":"154332447958158","info":{"id":"154332447958158","about":"PARA CONTRATACIONES TEL (81)18738066 Y AL (81) 18738067 id 62*12*1225 ventasremex@gmail.com","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":509077715816961,"source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/24619_509077715816961_160067283_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Monterrey N.L","description":"\t\nContrataciones. \nTels.

Pronounced “alt-J”, the delta sign is created when you hold down the alt key on your computer keyboard and punch ‘J’ on a Mac computer. The symbol has a deeper meaning for the band, as guitarist/bassist Gwil Sainsbury notes, “in mathematical equations it’s used to show change,” and the band’s relatively new name came at a turning point in their lives. \n\nGwil, Joe Newman [guitar/vocals], Gus Unger-Hamilton [keyboards] and Thom Green [drums] met at Leeds University in 2007. Gus studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their second year of studies, Joe played Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on Garageband. \n\nNeedless to say, the response to Joe’s hushed falsetto yelps and Gwil’s rudimentary sampling skills was good. When Thom was played the tracks he joined the band straight away. “I hadn’t heard anything like it,” he says. “It was music I was looking for, I just didn’t know I was. I just loved it.”\n\nGus completed the band’s lineup and together – first as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films – the four friends spent the next two years playing around town, developing a precise and unique brand of alt. pop that draws on poignant folk verses, crushing synths, smart hip hop syncopations and tight vocal harmonies. They dropped the moniker of Films in 2007, largely to avoid confusing the band with Californian punk troupe The Films. alt-J (∆) gave them a unique name to go with the unique ‘folk-step’ that they now concoct in the basement of a terrace house in Cambridgeshire.","booking_agent":"UK - Primary Talent International: nick@primarytalent.com / matt@primarytalent.com   America - The Windish Agency: tom@windishagency.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":457862364248809,"source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/532499_457862364248809_1332334650_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"general_manager":"East City Management","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Leeds","influences":"Haha","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":400859,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/altJ.band","name":"Alt-J","press_contact":"UK - Print / Online: caroline@insideslashout.com / Regional: iancheek@talk21.com / Radio: promo@ajpr.co.uk / Regional radio: jessica@radioactivepromotions.co.uk / Licensing: karen@infectiousmusicuk.com // USA - Print / Online: jim@bighassle.com","talking_about_count":9927,"username":"altJ.band","website":"www.altjband.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"One band, One dream, ONE DIRECTION.","id":"343853319026733","info":{"id":"343853319026733","about":"Dueñas & Creadoras:Ivonne♡ e Itzelitah♡...

Keteguhan mereka dalam mengibarkan idealisme telah menjadi inspirasi bagi sejumlah besar grup yang setia pada orisinalitas, tapi sulit mendapat peluang. Mereka memilih jadi musisi underdog daripada harus mengubah cita rasa musikalnya sekadar untuk mengikuti selera pasar.\n\nKarena itu, untuk debut albumnya, Four Through The Sap, Pas memilih mengedarkan sendiri melalui jalur teman, studio-studio latihan mau pun lokasi tempat mereka melangsungkan pertunjukan. Wilayah distribusinya pun masih sebatas Bandung dan Jakarta. Namun berkat kegigihan tersebut, satu celah terbuka sudah. Tiras penjualanya yang mencapai 5000 copies akhirnya mengantarkan mereka pada kontrak dengan PT Aquarius Musikindo, salah satu major label terkemuka di Indonesia.\n\nBerdiri di Bandung pada pertengahan tahun 1992, keunikan grup ini sudah terlihat dari cara mereka menggabungkan musik rock dengan lirik yang bernuansa sastra. Sebagian besar lirik memang ditulis Yukie, sarjana Sastra Jepang yang mantan dosen D3 Sastra Universitas Pajajaran Bandung (UNPAD). serta Trisno, lulusan Sastra Jerman dari universitas yang sama.\n\nDi kalangan insan musik, Pas juga dikenal sebagai musisi yang memiliki skill tinggi dalam memainkan instrumen. Penampilan enerjik mereka di atas panggung telah mengundang decak kagum Dave Ghrol, pentolan grup Foo Fighter dari Amerika, saat mereka tampil sepanggung dalam Jakarta Pop Alternative Festival yang digelar di Parkir Timur Senayan, Jakarta, April 1994. Saat itu mereka mendapat kehormatan untuk mendampingi Foo Fighters, Beastie Boys dan Sonic Youth.\n\nPada Agustus 2000 Pas kembali berhasil mencuri perhatian ketika ambil bagian di Busan International Rock Festival (BIROF) yang berlangsung di Seoul, Korea Selatan, di hadapan sekitar 100.000-an penonton. Peserta lainnya ketika itu antara lain Dimmu Borgir dan Night Wish.\n\nPada 2001, Pas membuat kejutan dengan menggandeng penyanyi cewek sebagai guest vocal dalam Kesepian Kita, sebuah nomor balada dari album Ketika… Album ini sempat mengundang kontroversi karena dianggap telah melenceng dari konsep musik mereka selama ini sebagai grup band yang agresif di atas panggung. Toh, langkah ini tidak menyurutkan jumlah penggemar mereka. Bahkan sebaliknya, semakin bertambah dengan muncul penggemar perempuan yang sebelumnya merupakan “mahluk asing” dalam setiap pertunjukan Pas.\n\nKejutan demi kejutan seperti tak pernah sepi setiap Pas meluncurkan album baru. Pada 2.0, misalnya, Pas mengaransemen ulang Yesterday milik The Beatles yang mashur itu menjadi lagu bercorak punk dan sekaligus menjadikan video clip-nya sebagai salah satu video clip yang paling sering diputar oleh MTV.\n\nKemudian setelah merekrut penyanyi cewek belia Tere dan merombak total Yesterday, selanjutnya Pas berkolaborasi dengan Reza, seorang diva R & B, lewat lagu Getir di albumnya yang ke-7, Stairway To Seventh. “Saya tertarik menerima tawaran dari Pas karena musik yang mereka bawakan selama ini sangat bertolak belakang dengan musik saya,” alasan Reza. “Ini sebuah tantangan.” Alasan yang kurang lebih sama meluncur dari Christopher Abimanyu, penyanyi tenor kenamaan negeri ini, saat diundang sebagai tamu dalam lagu Bayangan.\n\nBerubah-ubah bentuk akhirnya menjadi bentuk dari konsep musik Pas itu sendiri. Namun semua itu tetap mengalir dalam benang merah idealisme. Dan perjalanan sang waktu telah menjadikan Pas sebagai ikon musik underground di Indonesia, meski perjalanan kreatif mereka telah keluar jauh dari bingkai komunitas tersebut.\n\n\nhttp://www.pas-band.com/","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151292601354485","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/547582_10151292601354485_1840006887_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Bandung, Indonesia","general_manager":"Dadan M.

The group is composed of Park Gyuri, Han Seungyeon, Nicole Jung, Goo Hara, and Kang Jiyoung. The group's name comes from the Greek word \"chara\" , which they interpreted to mean \"sweet melody\".The group originally started off as a quartet and made their debut with \"Break It\" while displaying a strong female image and a mature R&B sound. Expectations for the group to be as big as their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L, were extremely high and the members were promoted as successors to them. They released their first studio album titled The First Blooming in March 2007. However, their debut was not well received by the public and was a commercial failure.The following year, Kim Sunghee departed the group due to parental pressure, and members Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung were brought in. After their addition, the group also changed their image and style of music to the \"pretty but natural\" appeal, releasing their first mini-album entitled Rock U in July 2008. They achieved their first number one song with \"Honey\" . In July 2009, the group released their second studio album entitled Revolution. The album spawned the hit single \"Mister\", whose choreography featured the \"butt-dance\", that helped increase the group's popularity within East Asia. Their follow-up singles including \"Lupin\" , \"Jumping\" , \"Step\" , and \"Pandora\" were also successful and helped further establish the group within the Korean music industry.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":427588,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kara/108549439169114","name":"Kara","talking_about_count":8880,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Pequeños Musical","id":"368679497927","info":{"id":"368679497927","about":"23 Años de ser \"La Banda Más Romántica de América\"","app_id":"0","band_members":"Gerardo Franco, Francisco Javier, Jorge Ramirez, Ramon Crisostomo, Jorge Morales, Juan Pablo, Mario Trigueros, Luis Angel, Aldo Franco, Jorge Ávila, Javier Sánchez, Gerardo Gómez, Roberto Carlos y Rogelio García.","bio":"1990 NACE EL CONCEPTO PEQUEÑOS MUSICAL:\n* Nace en el estado de Jalisco con 8 músicos:\nJorge Ramírez -Bajo-,\nJavier Sánchez -Batería-,\nGerardo Franco -Teclados/2da voz-,\nPercusión,\nVoz y 2 Trompetas,\nbajo la dirección de su Líder y Director el Sr. Rogelio García -Guitarra-.\n\n1991, Se posiciona entre los primeros lugares el tema: \"DE BRINQUITO\" del Álbum: \"14 éxitos\":\n*Graban su primer disco - de acetato jejeje -, conocido actualmente como \"14 ÉXITOS\", pero en realidad su título es \"DE BRINQUITO\", bajo el sello de Mueca Music - ya no existe esta casas disquera -.\n\n1993, Tema: \"LA CUCA\", Álbum: \"En Grande\"\n*Firman contrato por 10 años de exclusividad con la desaparecida disquera MCM, compañía que después se integraría a los activos de Warner Music.\n*En este año es en el que la Banda sale del anonimato y se dá a conocer en todo México y la Unión Americana con un buen tema rítmico, además con un sello muy particular.\n*Metidos \"PERFECTAMENTE\" en la moda de aquellos tiempos de \"LA QUEBRADITA\", de su álbum \"En Grande\", PEQUEÑOS MUSICAL graba \"LA CUCA\", este tema colocó a la Banda en los primeros lugares de popularidad en las listas de radios en ambos países, también fue el inicio de una larga y contínua fila de éxitos, que hasta el día de hoy permanecen vigentes.\n*Se incluye un nuevo músico, - suman en total 9 miembros -.","booking_agent":"OFICINA GDL (33) 3613 4092, (33) 3614 0120 y 01 (800) 284 8062.

The band wrote original music and knew their name didn’t fit the sound. At management's suggestion, the band named itself after the eccentric inventor Nikola TESLA, who pioneered the radio but was given only belated credit for doing so.\n\nAfter playing several showcases in Los Angeles, TESLA quickly scored a deal with Geffen and released their debut album, Mechanical Resonance, in 1986; it produced the hard rock hits and crowd favorite, \"Modern Day Cowboy\" and \"Little Suzi.\" Mechanical Resonance reached the Top 40 on the album charts, and eventually went platinum.\n\nIt was the follow-up, 1989's, which truly broke the band. The first single, \"Heaven's Trail (No Way Out),\" was a hit with hard rock audiences, setting the stage for the second single, a comforting ballad called \"Love Song\" which substituted a dash of hippie utopianism for the usual power ballad histrionics.\n\n\n\n\"Love Song\" hit the pop Top Ten and made the band stars, pushing The Great Radio Controversy into the Top 20 and double-platinum sales figures; the follow-up single, \"The Way It Is,\" was also a hit.\n\nIn keeping with their unpretentious, blue-collar roots, TESLA responded to stardom not by the glam theatrics of their tour mates and peers of the era, but by stripping things down. The idea behind 1990's, Five Man Acoustical Jam was virtually unheard of -- a pop-metal band playing loose, informal acoustic versions of their best-known songs in concert, plus a few favorite covers.\n\nTESLA's music was sturdy enough to hold up when its roots were exposed, and one of the covers, \"Signs,\" became another Top Ten hit, as well as the band's highest-charting single. Not only did Five Man Acoustical Jam reach the Top 20 and go Platinum, it helped directly inspire MTV's \"Unplugged\" series, both with its relaxed vibe and its reminder that acoustic music could sound vital and energetic. This album is credited for starting the whole “Unplugged” craze of the ‘90s which included artist like Eric Clapton, Nirvana, and many others following suit with acoustic live albums.\n\nThe studio follow-up to The Great Radio Controversy, Psychotic Supper, was released in 1991 and quickly became another platinum hit and spun off the greatest number of singles of any TESLA album: \"Edison's Medicine,\" \"Call It What You Want,\" \"Song and Emotion,\" and the classic hit, “What You Give,” which was another one of TESLA’s ballad singles that reached Top 20 radio airplay.\n\nTheir 1994 follow-up, Bust a Nut, sold over 800,000 copies, and battling the \"Seattle Invasion\" in 1994, was a testament to the loyal fan base TESLA had managed to cultivate over the years. The single, “Mama’s Fool” was well received, however at this point the band was suffering internal problems and decided to dis-band for the next five years.\n\nReturning with their first studio album of all original music, TESLA wrote and recorded the album Into the Now, and for the first time, self produced the album along with audio engineer Michael Rosen (Testament, AFI, Santana). Released in March, 2004, Into The Now was an autobiographical testament of a band from a previous decade plunging forward into a new era of music, and producing a sound that could compete with modern music of the day. The album successfully showed that the band could evolve sonically with aggressive songs like “Heaven 911” and the title track “Into the Now,” and “Caught in a Dream” which received massive radio airplay as well.\n\nDuring this time, management and label changes were made, bringing us to the independent era of today’s TESLA.\n\nIn 2008, the band released its seventh studio album, Forever More, an all-new collection of songs including, \"I Wanna Live,\" “Breakin’ Free,” \"Fallin' Apart\" and the title track “Forever More.” The release reunited the band with producer Terry Thomas, who helmed 1994's, Bust a Nut.\n\nTESLA is more creative now than ever, simultaneously creating and producing their own videos and albums. The release of the self-produced Comin Atcha Live 2008! marks their first ever HD release of a full electric concert DVD.\n\nWith this new-found creativity and the album Forever More, the band has taken control of their career, releasing the album on CD (and a limited-edition vinyl package) around the world through their band-owned and operated label, TESLA Electric Company Recordings.\n\nFormation and Mechanical Resonance (1984-1988)\nThe band formed in 1984 in Sacramento as City Kidd, and was renamed TESLA during the recording of their first album, 1986's Mechanical Resonance, on the advice of their manager that City Kidd was not a great name (in addition, there was already another band going by that name). The band derived their name, certain album and song titles, and some song content from events relating to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola TESLA.\n\nThe band's original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, bassist Brian Wheat, and drummer Troy Luccketta.\n\nTESLA's music is often referred to as heavy metal, but is better described as blues metal. The band's lyrics also strayed from the themes popular in heavy metal, particularly in the 1980s at the beginning of their career. A further distinction from their contemporaries was their T-shirt-and-jeans image which was in strong contrast to glam metal bands of the time, which were characterized by big hair, leather pants, and flashy makeup. Also in the early days of their career, TESLA toured with David Lee Roth, Def Leppard, and Poison which incorrectly resulted in the band being categorized as a Glam metal band. The band's members resented this labelling.\n\nThe Great Radio Controversy and Psychotic Supper (1989-1993)\nIt was three years before the band released their second album, The Great Radio Controversy. The album helped solidify the band's growing reputation and fan base. The album produced the hit single, a classic 80's power ballad \"Love Song\".\n\n\n\nIn 1990, TESLA released Five Man Acoustical Jam, a live album featuring acoustic renditions of hits such as \"Cumin' Atcha Live\", \"Gettin' Better\", \"Modern Day Cowboy\", and \"Love Song\". The album also featured a number of covers most notably a version of \"Signs\", a 1971 hit by the Five Man Electrical Band.\n\n\n\nIn 1991 the band released their third studio album Psychotic Supper. The band themselves consider this to be their best album according to their official web site.The 1998 Japanese reissue import of Psychotic Supper contains three previously unreleased songs, including \"Rock the Nation\", \"I Ain't Superstitious\", and \"Run Run Run\".\n\nBust a Nut and hiatus (1994-1999)\nIn 1994 the band released their fourth studio album Bust a Nut. The 1998 Japanese reissue import of Bust a Nut contains the previously unreleased cover of Led Zeppelin's \"The Ocean\".\n\nAfter the release of Bust a Nut, Skeoch departed because of his struggle with substance abuse. He rejoined after completing rehab. Only to depart again months later. The band moved forward as a four piece for a shortwhile. However, it wasn't long before Skeoch briefly joined up with solo artist Marshall Coleman's band to support his solo career, only to see a departure of Marshall soon after. This band eventually morphed to include Jeff Keith and resurfaced as Bar 7 with a single \"Four Leaf Clover\", from the album The World Is a Freak. Brian Wheat formed Soulmotor and Frank Hannon Moon Dog Mane, while Troy Luccketta worked with several local artists including the Bay Area's One Thin Dime.\n\nReunion (2000-present)\nAfter a break of six years, the Sacramento Bee reported that the band had reformed in 2000 with the help of local radio personality Pat Martin of KRXQ. The band played an emotional sold out show at The Arco Arena in Sacramento on October 25, 2000. Soon after they recorded the double live album Replugged Live. In 2002 they were featured in the Rock Never Stops Tour alongside other 1980s rock bands.\n\n2002 saw the release of a further live album Standing Room Only which is just a single CD version of Replugged Live'.\n\nIn 2004 they released their fifth studio album Into the Now which debuted on the Billboard album chart at number 30. The album was well received by fans and the band was featured on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.\n\nIn February 2005, TESLA headlined a benefit show at the PPAC in Providence, Rhode Island for the victims of the Station nightclub fire. During the show the band auctioned off an autographed acoustic guitar with the proceeds going to the Station Family Fund. 100% of the ticket sales also went to this charity.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, the band embarked on the Electric Summer Jam Tour and put the following statement on their Web site: \"We would like you to join us in welcoming guitarist Dave Rude, who will be hitting the road with us for the 2006 Electric Summer Jam Tour as Tommy Skeoch will not be performing with us. Please also join us in congratulating Tommy and his wife on the birth of their new baby boy. We wish the whole family the best\".\n\nAn article in the Deseret Morning News (June 16, 2006) that featured an interview with Wheat clarified the situation: \"The tour is also a chance to introduce the newest member of the band, guitarist Dave Rude, who replaced Tommy Skeoch. Skeoch has been in and out of the band since 1994, addressing substance abuse problems. But with a new baby at home, this time Skeoch's departure is final. He just wanted to spend more time with his family after all these years. It's hard. He'll always be a part of TESLA history\". Although Mr. Skeoch stated in an interview with \"Classic Metal Show\", that he wanted to spend time with his family was just an \"official\" statement, and he left because of other reasons. Skeoch has said \"I'll never say never; who knows, maybe I'll go back someday\".\n\n\"Cumin' Atcha Live\" appeared in the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\n\nTESLA have recorded a covers album titled Real to Reel, which was released on June 5, 2007. The recording is available as a 2 CD set. The first CD (containing 13 songs) is sold in a case with a blank slot for the second CD. The second CD (containing 12 additional songs) will initially be available to concert goers in the USA at no additional charge beyond the cost of a ticket. The second CD was also given away with the August edition of Classic Rock magazine in Europe.\n\nAt the end of August TESLA announced their first world tour in 16 years with dates in Australia, Japan, and Europe in October and November 2007.\n\nIn February 2008, TESLA helped fund and headlined a benefit concert for victims of the Station nightclub fire. The show was broadcast by VH1 Classic. TESLA played three songs: \"What You Give\", \"Signs\", and \"Love Song\", though \"What You Give\" did not make it onto the broadcast.\n\nIn June and July 2008, TESLA played few shows in Europe and in the USA, including Sweden Rock Festival, Graspop Metal Meeting and Rocklahoma.\n\nOn August 11, 2008, it was reported that TESLA's next album, entitled Forever More, would be released on October 7 on their own record label, TESLA Electric Company Recordings. The album was produced by Terry Thomas, who produced Bust a Nut. The band aired the album's first single, \"I Wanna Live\" on radio stations across the globe on August 18 and kicked off a world tour on October 1. Forever More debuted No. 33 on The Billboard 200 chart and spawned singles I Wanna Live, Fallin' Apart & Breakin' Free. In 2009, it was announced that TESLA will be among the performers on the cruise ship \"ShipRocked\" in November 2009.\n\nIn 2010, the band announced that they are working on material for a new album and announced they will be playing at Rocklahoma MAY 2010.\nBand Members\n\n    Jeff Keith – lead vocals (1984–1996, 2000–present)\n    Frank Hannon – lead & rhythm guitars, piano, organ, Hammond organ, backing vocals (1984–1996, 2000–present)\n    Dave Rude – lead & rhythm guitars, backing vocals (2006–present)\n    Brian Wheat – bass, piano, backing vocals (1984–1996, 2000–present)\n    Troy Luccketta – drums, percussion (1984–1996, 2000–present)\n","booking_agent":"booking@teslatheband.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151432931010878","source":"http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/431948_10151432931010878_264460489_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50},"current_location":"Sacramento, CA","description":"TESLA is a multi-platinum selling rock band from Northern California known for their melodic songs and down to earth appeal.

Founding members, Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (along with former band mate Dan Peek) met in high school in London in the late 1960s and quickly harmonized their way to the top of the charts on the strength of their signature song \"A Horse With No Name”. America became a global household name and paved the way with an impressive string of hits following the success of their first #1 single. Forty years later, these friends are still making music together, touring the world and thrilling audiences with their timeless sound.\n\nAmerica's journey has found them exploring a wide variety of musical terrain. Their best-known tunes, which also include \"I Need You,\" \"Ventura Highway,\" \"Don't Cross The River,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair\" were cornerstones of 1970’s Top 40 and FM rock radio. Yet beyond their impressive catalog of hits, listeners would discover there was always much more to America than surface perceptions. The combination of Gerry Beckley’s melodic pop rock and Dewey Bunnell’s use of folk-jazz elements, slinky Latin-leaning rhythms and impressionistic lyric imagery contrasted well with Dan Peek's more traditional country-rock leanings and highly personal lyrics.\n\nAmerica's albums--six certified gold and/or platinum, with their first greatest hits collection, History, hitting four+ million in sales--displayed a fuller range of the trio's talents than did their singles. Their material encompassed an ambitious artistic swath; from effects-laden rockers to oddball medleys to soul-bearing ballads, America displayed a flawless blend of disparate genres and styles as wide-open as the great American plains.\n\nEnjoying massive success early in their career, America earned their stripes as musical soldiers on the battlefield amidst the excess, craziness and chaos of the 70’s. The trio won the Grammy® for Best New Artist in 1972 and began\nworking with George Martin and Geoff Emerick in 1974. This successful team\nwent on to record seven albums and several Top Ten hits, including “Tin Man” and “Sister Golden Hair”.\n\nBy the mid-70s, inter-band conflicts combined with an exhaustive touring and recording schedule exacted its toll on the group. With Peek’s departure from the fold in 1977, his band mates rose to the challenge and carried on as a duo. Shifts in sound and direction, changes in producers and managers, and a renewed dedication to the craft of songwriting helped rocket America to the upper reaches of the pop charts in 1982 with their smash single, \"You Can Do Magic.\" During this tumultuous time in their career, Beckley and Bunnell immersed themselves in their craft, infusing a newfound maturity into their rich body of work. Their growth as singers, songwriters and musicians has continued into the present day as illustrated by landmark releases such as 2000’s Highway 3-disc box set, 2002’s Holiday Harmony, an album comprised of seasonal classics and live showcases, 2007's Here & Now and 2009’s Live In Concert: Wildwood Springs.\n\nFrom their formative years, America has been a band capable of transcending borders with its uplifting music and positive message. Embracing a rainbow of divergent cultures, America’s audiences continue to grow, comprising a loyal legion of first, second and third generation fans, all bearing testament to the group’s enduring appeal. \"I think that the ingredients of the America sound are the basic fundamentals that translate internationally,\" explains Beckley. \"The Italians are huge fans of dance music, but they also love a ballad--they're romantic at heart. It's the same in the Far East. A lot of times in these countries, we see people singing along, and they don't really know what the words mean. Music is truly the international language.\"\n\nIn the midst of their 40th-year anniversary of music making, America continues to evolve while remaining a perennial mainstay on the domestic and international concert circuit and a cornerstone of 70’s Top 40 and FM rock radio. In addition to their classics, America is revisiting their roots as writers and artists. The 40th Anniversary show features songs reflecting some of their song-writing inspirations as well as showcasing their first album America with a very special acoustic set featuring standards such as \"I Need You\" and \"Three Roses\", as well as some never-before-performed deep cuts.\n\nFrom anonymous horses to fast-moving trains, America’s extraordinary four-decade musical legacy of consummately crafted pop/rock songs, trademark lush harmonies and evocative lyrical landscapes will never go out of style.","booking_agent":"William Morris Endeavor","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":445275248858581,"source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/206284_445275248858581_2043481649_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"description":"Official America Facebook page!

The present state of the band is as close to ideal as rock n’ roll can be. Having assembled a true creative and personal collective, designed and signed the record deal of his dreams, and made a fantastic new album free of any influence other than his onstage brothers in arms, it's hard to imagine that Bridwell cares to dwell on any time but the present. It took nearly 2 years, virtual bankruptcy, five states and a dead falcon to get there, but Infinite Arms is the product of a band doing things on their own terms and finally learning to enjoy the results.  \n \n \tThe songs on Infinite Arms project the essence of the different locales across America that became the setting for the recording and songwriting process behind the album. The serene woods of Northern Minnesota and the band’s native Carolinas inspired the songwriting, lending the compositions an air of comfort and familiarity. While those locations helped the songs come to life, the sounds were influenced by the recording settings. The rich musical heritage of Muscle Shoals, AL, the sublime beauty of Asheville’s Blue Ridge Mountains, the glamorous Hollywood Hills and the vast Mojave desert helped yield the group’s most focused and dynamic recordings to date.\n \n \tInfinite Arms was a group effort in the truest sense of the phrase. Trading song ideas remotely and then joining in the studio to work through arrangements led to writing credits for all five band members throughout the record,  making the album a reflection of the taste and style of each Horse.  Bridwell is the lone constant member since Everything All the Time, the band’s 2006 debut, but if you ask him he might tell you that Infinite Arms is just that: a debut in the sense that he entered the studio for the first time with a group of musicians working together as a cohesive force. All members made invaluable contributions to the inimitable sound that Bridwell has crafted since the band’s inception.  \n     \n \tBand of Horses is Bridwell, Creighton Barrett, Ryan Monroe, Tyler Ramsey and Bill Reynolds. The quintet have long standing ties: Monroe and Bridwell played baseball together in grade school, Ramsey and Reynolds cut their teeth in the same Asheville, NC music scene, and Barrett met Bridwell at a party as teenagers, where they bonded instantly over a mutual obsession with Dinosaur Jr. Over the course of a few years, they gradually synched up. Barrett appeared behind the kit on Cease to Begin, while Monroe joined the band on keys toward the end of the writing process of that record. Reynolds came into the fold almost by accident as he happened upon a recording session with the band at his friend’s Echo Mountain Studios and joined the touring lineup soon after. Ramsey,  already an established solo artist, joined after Reynolds introduced him to the band  in 2007, starting to tour just prior to the release of Cease to Begin and opening the shows with a set of his own material. \n \nThe novelty of and high hopes for these new members demanded a completely uninhibited recording process. Anything less would have been disservice, and recognizing the most important element used to exert influence, Bridwell decided the only way to insure creative control was to finance the record himself. The result was liberating, the only dictator the creative muse . The band obeyed its every order.  Strings and horns were brought in, guitar players played percussion, vocals were run through the same reverb tanks that treated the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” and a backyard amphibian chorus sang the title tracks’ outro. Studios, engineers, pizza and whiskey are not cheap however, and near bankruptcy from recording costs prolonged the albums completion as the band had to spend time on the road to afford the next session. The resulting shows were among the best in the bands history. A sold out Carnegie Hall, epic festival sets, the now customary New Years Eve shows in Atlanta, and performances with musical idols Neil Young, Willie Nelson and Roger McGuinn kept things fresh and vibrant. The touring also helped combat studio malaise, and allowed the band to enter each recording session recharged and armed with new ideas. The thrill of honing the new material in a live setting gave the songs an edge that is difficult to capture when sedentary. \n\nWhile the band initially enlisted their long time producer Phil Ek to take the helm, scheduling conflicts led to a band decision to produce the majority of the record on their own. This unexpected occurrence added another dimension to the credence of freedom that seeped into every aspect of Infinite Arms.\n\n    \tThe freedom was not limited to the music.  The band was looking at landscape of the business with a fresh perspective as their contract with Sub Pop had expired. Armed with their finest work to date, the band began entertaining suitors in the search for the one who would understand Bridwell’s vision for a new record deal. Perhaps ironically, part of this deal involved Bridwell returning in a certain fashion to his first role in the business - a label president. Predating any foray into musicianship, and completely oblivious to his talent at the time, Bridwell started Brown Records while living in Seattle. \"Brown Records came about thanks to two major factors. I had talented friends and I hated my job.\" he says. Those talented friends were a band called Carissas Wierd.\"I always considered myself their biggest fan and supporter so around this time I decided it was up to me to see that these recordings were available to any local set of ears willing to listen. I had moved up from my dishwashing position to line cook now and was making good tips, but held tons of resentment for a lot of the management, promoters, and even some bands that I was feeding every night that I felt treated me like a second class citizen, only there to cook for them and deal with their sometimes devilish moods. I retaliated by saving every shitty tip I got at the end of the night and stuffing it into a dead space in a stereo speaker. I'd have to crack the thing open like a piggy bank one day and ruin my listening environment to get it out, but for good reason. There was little doubt in my mind that the plan would work. I just didn't figure how well it would work. \" \n     \n         \"I finally cracked my speaker open one day to reveal what I would think was probably around five or six hundred dollars. This was hardly enough to press a batch of 1,000 cds at the time, so I weaseled a loan out of my father for the rest of the cash. With a wonderful crackpot team of art director Jeff Montano and mastering engineer Joe Crawford (RIP) we got all the specifics together and pulled off the remarkable feat that was BROWN 001 Carissa's Wierd 'Ugly But Honest: 1996-1999'\" A label boss was born.  Bridwell continued to release records by Carissas Wierd and other local acts including S and Aveo, and eventually joined Carissas Wierd as the band’s drummer, leading the way to the discovery of his musical talent, a fortunate occurrence for his fans.  \n \n       Brown eventually became a distant priority behind Bridwell’s new day job as a professional musician, but his passion for discovering and nurturing talent never left. When it came time to haggle with label suitors, he insisted on resurrecting Brown as an imprint to release the Band of Horses record through in conjunction with Fat Possum and Columbia, and to ultimately discover, nurture and release new talent , with his friends at Fat Possum handling marketing and distribution.\n \n       Infinite Arms continues the collaboration between the band and their aesthetic director Christopher Wilson. Bridwell and Wilson have a long standing friendship that dates back to their meeting in Tucson, AZ and subsequent days of washing dishes together at famed Seattle club The Crocodile. They added a professional element to their relationship when Wilson began designing Band of Horses album artwork beginning with the first record, and going on the road with the band as their photographer, while also running the projections that appear on the backdrop behind the band at each gig. An extremely talented photographer of natural landscapes, Wilson’s view of the world has added the perfect visual accompaniment to the band’s sound. Wilson’s photographs and drawings will grace all versions of Infinite Arms, including the stunning deluxe edition which consists of the 180 gram vinyl, LP, CD, DVD featuring HD videos for every song created by Wilson and synched to a 5.1 surround sound mix by Elliot Scheiner, all packaged together in a 100 plus page coffee table book featuring Wilson’s nature photographs.  \n \n      The title of the record is another Bridwellian play on words. He'll never let on to what it means, the only hint that it’s a phrase possibly misheard by thousands of people every day. Dwell on that one if you want to drive yourself nuts.

Después de ir logrando sus primeras metas y objetivos como banda, graban un disco independiente de nombre Blanco como las nubes(1993) que los da a conocer en la escena de su natal Monterrey y otras ciudades como Guadalajara, San Luis Potosí, León, Querétaro y el Distrito Federal. Durante este tiempo la alineación del grupo va tomando forma. Pronto comenzaron a ser reconocidos en la escena del ska en México gracias a sus canciones y su peculiar estilo, el cual tiene como esencia el reggae y el ska, pero que también transita por caminos de la bachata jazz y rockabilly, con toques rítmicos y letras románticas con las cuales el público se identificó de inmediato. En 1998 ganan el premio \"Nuestro Rock\" como mejor grupo nuevo lo que los lleva a presentarse en más ciudades.Después de un largo andar y cientos de conciertos alrededor de México, en el 2001 son firmados por la disquera Universal Music México y lanzan su disco \"Alma En Fuego\", disco que alcanzaría disco de platino por sus altas ventas y del cual se desprendió su primer sencillo \"Amnesia\", que realizaron con la colaboración de Riki luis de monterrey, Roco (vocalista del grupo Maldita Vecindad) y Rubén Albarrán (vocalista de Café Tacuba). A este primer sencillo le siguieron los sencillos “Amargo Adiós”, “Cara de Chango”, “Sin Rencor” y el tema futbolero “Aguante”.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":371798,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Inspector-band/112960262052077","name":"Inspector (band)","talking_about_count":6589,"website":"http://www.inspector.com.mx/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"'Soo The Spilt Band [FC]","id":"343566705665788","info":{"id":"343566705665788","about":"เพจนี้เป็นเพจสำหรับ Fc The Split นะจ้ะ ","app_id":"0","bio":"ชื่อจริง : ศตายุ นาคทองเพชร\nชื่อเล่น : โซ่ :D\nอายุ : 17 ปี เกิดวันที่ 4 มีนาคม 2538 โรงบาลลาดพร้าว เวลาประมาน 5 โมงครึ่ง\nการเรียน : ม.6 สารสาสน์วิเทศสายไหม \nส่วนสูง : 171 ซม. น้ำหนัก : ประมาณ 50 กก.\nร้องเพลง Cover ลง Youtube วง The Split Band\nเป็นมือ กีตาร์ เล่นกีตาร์มาประมาณ 3 ปี \nมีน้องชาย ชื่อ ซุง อยู่ ม.2 โรงเรียนเดียวกัน ชอบเล่นกีตาร์เหมือนกันด้วย\nลายเซ็นตรงกีตาร์พี่โซ่เป็นของ sungha jung กับ andy mckee\nสีที่ชอบ : ทุกสี :DD\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":564080256947764,"source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/942373_564080256947764_809017420_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":36109,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/ThesplitSoo","name":"'Soo The Spilt Band [FC]","talking_about_count":6569,"username":"ThesplitSoo","website":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Soo-The-Spilt-Band-FC","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"SwittinS GirlBand","id":"256885771044727","info":{"id":"256885771044727","about":"SwittinS Girlband terdiri dari 4 orang: Celine, Chinta, Cindy, & Tasya","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"T-Five","awards":"Salah satu kunci sukses iklan produk adalah jingle iklannya yang enak di dengar.

Setelah lama mencari tanpa hasil, dia kemudian berinisiatif untuk mebuat berbagai materi lagu yang seluruh pengerjaan musiknya dilakukan oleh sendiri dan akibatnya, masalah baru pun timbul ketika Ia harus mendapatkan seseorang untuk mengisi vocal.\n\n     Tak lama kemudian ia menghubungi female vocal bernama Riska Elfira serta Chris Bobby (Drummer) yang merupakan teman sekelasnya dibangku kuliah sekaligus merupakan anggota Paduan Suara Mahasiswa (Pasuma) UNISBA mempunyai karakter vocal yang cocok dengan \"Moses Bandwidth\".Sekitar bulan Maret 2005, \"Moses Bandwidth\" telah merampungkan sebuah single pertamanya berjudul \"Selangkah Menuju Surga\" yang proses recordingnya dilakukan secara profesional di MMS Studio, Indramayu.\n\n   Akhir 2005 Moses Bandwidth mengontak Steven Jozeph untuk bergabung sebagai Bass player dan segera merilis album pertama “Behind The Darkness” yang diproduseri oleh Budi Santet dari Master Of Disharmony Records. Tour promo album pertama diawali pada kota Purwokerto, Dimmy yang merupakan Gitaris Elmeod langsung mengisi posisi aditional gitar\n\n             Pada pertengahan tahun 2006 Band Moses Bandwidth kembali masuk studio untuk merekam materi album kedua yang bertitle “Renaisaance” setelah sekitar lima bulan proses recording, Renaisaance dirilis oleh Inviolable Music yang diproduseri oleh Bob Wendo, Single hits Falling Down segera dipublikasikan ke berbagai media, promo tour album kedua mencakup berbagai kota jawa tengah seperti Semarang, Cilacap, dan sekitarnya,\n\n             Ditahun 2007 line up ini menyelesaikan pre production untuk album ke 3 yang bertitle Arabian Dreams With The Final Requiem yang dirilis oleh R-A Production, serta menyiapkan tour promo sepanjang tahun 2007 untuk mendukung penjualan album\n\n     Saat itulah merupakan langkah bagi \"Moses Bandwidth\" untuk mengukir jejaknya di komunitas musik Indonesia, dan hingga kini mereka masih tetap berkarya untuk merampungkan promo CD / demo tape mereka yang terbaru dan tour promo ke berbagai kota Indonesia.","booking_agent":"booking@mosesbandwidth.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":552166448160956,"source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/21270_552166448160956_500061716_n.jpg","offset_y":23,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Bandung","general_manager":"Nandang Hutabakara","genre":"Gothic Metal","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Bandung","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":59382,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/MOSES-BANDWIDTH/125564574154481","name":"MOSES BANDWIDTH","press_contact":"info@mosesbandwidth.com","record_label":"GARASI REBEL Records","talking_about_count":6491,"website":"www.mosesbandwidth.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"ADAMMO","id":"9029481590","info":{"id":"9029481590","about":"MANAGEMENT/ BOOKING: j.sierraalta@kandavu.com (+51) 940-432-549","app_id":"0","band_members":"ADAMMO:\nwww.twitter.com/Adammoband\n\nEZIO :\nwww.twitter.com/EzioOliva\nwww.facebook.com/Ezioliva\n\nDIEGO : \nwww.twitter.com/DiegoUbierna\nwww.facebook.com/MrWillieCash\n\nRENZO :\nwww.twitter.com/RenzoBravo\nwww.facebook.com/renzobravoo\n\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151304305106591","source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/430882_10151304305106591_716115772_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"LIMA","description":"\n","general_manager":"Alejandro Gonzalez | alejandro@kandavu.com","genre":"POP","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"PERU","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":561078,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/AdammoBand","name":"ADAMMO","record_label":"independientes","talking_about_count":6366,"username":"AdammoBand","website":"www.adammo.net","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Death","id":"115435901799743","info":{"id":"115435901799743","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"Death was an American metal band founded in 1983. The band's founder, Chuck Schuldiner, is considered \"a pioneering force in death metal\". The band ceased to exist after Schuldiner died of brain cancer in 2001, though it remains an enduring metal brand.Death is considered one of the most influential bands in metal. The band's debut, Scream Bloody Gore, has been described as \"death metal's first archetypal document\" and \"the first true death metal record\". One music biographer has referred to Schuldiner as the \"Father of Death Metal\" while another has claimed that Schuldiner is \"readily acknowledged as the true founder of the U.S. death metal scene\".As of 2008, Death had sold over 2 million albums worldwide, with over 500,000 copies sold by December 2009 in the U.S. alone (excluding the numerous sales before the SoundScan era) making them the top-selling death metal band worldwide.BiographyEarly history (1983–1987)Founded in 1983 by Chuck Schuldiner under the original name of Mantas in Orlando, Death was among the more widely known, early pioneers of the death metal sound along with California's Possessed. In the late 80s, the band was both a part of and integral in defining the death metal scene which gained international recognition with the release of albums by a number of area acts.Together with Kam Lee (Barney Kamalani Lee), and Rick Rozz (Frederick DeLillo), Schuldiner started to compose songs that were released on several rehearsal tapes in 1984. These tapes, along with the Death by Metal demo, circulated through the tape-trader world, quickly establishing the band's name. In 1984, Schuldiner dissolved Mantas and quickly started a new band under the name Death. Tim Aymar, in an article written in December 2010, states that Chuck Schuldiner renamed the band Death in order to turn his experience of the death of his brother Frank years earlier into \"something positive\". Its members included the same Rick Rozz and Kam Lee. Another demo was released, called Reign of Terror.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":472379,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Death/115435901799743","name":"Death","talking_about_count":6344,"website":"http://www.emptywords.org","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Mild Band","id":"137719796117","info":{"id":"137719796117","about":"ติดต่องาน 081-255-4745 (ผู้จัดการวง-คุณแต๋ม)\nสั่งซื้อเสื้อ www.facebook.com/hohpage\nตารางงาน www.facebook.com/mildband/notes","app_id":"0","band_members":"Vocal : Bodin Chareunratch [Pae]\nGuitar : Jane Manopiniwes [Tao]\nSax : Phaisit Khamklan [Pae]\nBass : Pittawas Khunthong [Khun]\nKeyboard : Nathepat Prasertmanukitch [TomTom]\nDrum : Thongchai Timpool [Mike]","bio":"Mild เป็นการรวมตัวของละอ่อนมัธยมเชียงใหม่ ที่ต่างคนต่างเล่นดนตรีเปิดหมวกบนถนนคนเดิน จนได้ชักชวนกันตั้งวง และไล่ล่าหาฝันด้วยกัน กับการประกวดเวทีต่างๆ\n \n- ศึกษาจนจบ ปริญญาตรี จากมหาวิทยาลัยเชียงใหม่, มหาวิทยาลัยมหิดล \n- เก็บเกี่ยวประสบการณ์ดนตรีจากผับที่เชียงใหม่ \"Warm Up Cafe\"\n\nปี 2011\n- Mild ถูกเสนอชื่อเข้าชิงรางวัล TV Pool Top Award สาขา \"ศิลปินยอดเยี่ยม\"\n- Mild ถูกเสนอชื่อเข้าชิงรางวัล สาขาศิลปินคู่และกลุ่มสุดซี้ดประจำปี (Seed Awards #6)\n- Featuring กับ พี่ขัน Thaitanium ในเพลง \"I'm not superstar\"\n\nปี 2010\n- \"ผู้ป่วยความจำเสื่อม\"ถูกเสนอชื่อเข้าชิงรางวัล สาขาเพลงยอดนิยมสุดซี้ดประจำปี (Seed Awards #5)\n- \"ผู้ป่วยความจำเสื่อม\"ถูกเสนอชื่อเข้าชิงรางวัล สาขาเพลงยอดเยี่ยม (Hamberger Awards #7)\n- Mild เข้าชิงสองรางวัล รางวัลเพลงฮิตโดนใจ กับรางวัลนักร้องกลุ่มยอดนิยม (สยามดารา Awards #5)\n- \"หวานเย็น\" ถูกนำไปใช้ประกอบภาพยนตร์ \"ตุ๊กกี้ คนขายกบ\"\n- ออกอัลบั้มที่ 2 ชื่อชุดว่า \"Ma-Show\" กับค่าย Nano Records บรรจุทั้งสิ้น 12 เพลง\n- Featuring กับ พี่แบงค์เสื้อใต้ BZ ในเพลง \"รัก is here\"\n\nปี 2009\n- Mild ได้รับรางวัลศิลปินหน้าใหม่ยอดเยี่ยมสุดซี้ดประจำปี (Seed Awards #4)\n- Mild ได้รับรางวัลศิลปินหน้าใหม่ยอดเยี่ยม (POP Channel)\n- Mild ได้รับรางวัลศิลปินใบบัวบก (OK Radio)\n- Mild ถูกเสนอชื่อเข้าชิงรางวัล สาขาศิลปินหน้าใหม่ยอดเยี่ยม (Channel V)\n- Mild ถูกเสนอชื่อเข้าชิงรางวัล สาขาศิลปินหน้าใหม่ยอดเยี่ยม (Fat Awards #9)\n- ออกคาราโอเกะชุด \"คารา(มายด์)โอเกะ\" เอาไว้ให้เพื่อนๆได้ร้องแก้คันปาก\n- ออกอัลบัมรวมศิลปิน Ford & Friends\n- \"Unlovable\" ถูกนำไปใช้ประกอบภาพยนตร์ \"แต๋วเตะตีนระเบิด\"\n- \"Unlovable\" ถูกนำไปใช้ประกอบละคร \"หัวใจ2ภาค\"\n\nปี 2008\n- ออกอัลบั้มแรกที่มีชื่อเดียวกับวง \"Mild\" กับค่าย Nano Records เป็นมินิอัลบั้ม 6 เพลง\n- Unlovable ได้เป็นเพลงอันดับ 1 จาก 100 เพลง Hitz Countdown Song (Virgin Htiz)\n\nปี 2007\n- ออกอัลบั้ม Werk Shop จาก Werk Records มีเพลง Surprise เป็น 1 ในอัลบั้ม\n","booking_agent":"พี่แต๋ม +668-1255-4745","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151520574106118","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/64175_10151520574106118_967316243_n.jpg","offset_y":65,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Bangkok, Thailnad","description":"Download ได้ที่ *491544 โทรออกแล้วกด 09 \nติดต่องาน 081-255-4745 (ผู้จัดการวง-คุณแต๋ม)\nสั่งซื้อเสื้อ www.facebook.com/hohpage\nตารางงาน www.facebook.com/mildband/notes","general_manager":"Rossukhon Wanphra","genre":"Variety Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":412334,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/mildband","name":"Mild Band","record_label":"Spicy Disc","talking_about_count":6241,"username":"mildband","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Obituary band","id":"327554930956","info":{"id":"327554930956","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"Celtic Frost, Venom, Slayer, Nasty Savage, Savatage, etc..","band_interests":"This is the \"Official\" Facebook Of Obituary.","band_members":"::current members::\nJohn Tardy -----Vocals (1984-current)\nTrevor Peres --- Guitar (1984-current)\nDonald Tardy - Drums (1984-current)\nTerry Butler ------ Bass (2010-current)\n\n::touring members::\nKenny Andrews - Bass, & Guitar (2010, 2011)\nSteve Digiorgio -- Bass (2010)\nLee Harrison---Guitar (2012)\n\n::former members::\nJerome Grable ---- Bass (1984-1988)\nAllen West ------- Guitar (1984–1989, 1992–2006)\nDaniel Tucker ----- Bass (1988–1989)\nFrank Watkins ---- Bass (1989–2010)\nJames Murphy -- Guitar (1990)\nRalph Santolla---Guitar (2007-2011)","bio":"This is the \"Official\" Facebook Of Obituary.\nUpon switching their name from Xecutioner to Obituary, the career of one of the most successful and influential Death Metal bands began. Hailing from Florida and featuring John Tardy (vocals), brother Donald Tardy (drums), Trevor Peres (guitar), Allen West (guitar), and Daniel Tucker (bass), the band signed to Roadracer Records, a now defunct division of Roadrunner, for the recording of their debut album—the immense and immeasurably heavy “Slowly We Rot” (1989). The album was engineered by the legendary Scott Burns at Morrisound Studio, which would come to be the most sought after facility for production of albums during 1990’s rise of the Death Metal genre. Unlike much death metal preceding it, the album had a sludgy feel and integrated devastatingly slow passages along with obliterating overtures that reached far beyond any point of mayhem that metal had yet to reach; the result was a carnal pleasure for doom, death and thrash fans alike coupling the adrenaline of a speedball with the slow, degrading measures of a sewer at dusk. Like them or not, Obituary was unlike anything anyone had heard before. \n\n“Slowly We Rot” was chaotic, bass heavy mix of manic guitar solos and crashing drums, but it was undeniably characterized by vocalist John Tardy’s disarmingly horrific, gargling style, that created guttural chasms of dread which though often strived for, to date have been paralleled by none. The ability to augment tempo so drastically became the band’s trademark along with Tardy’s unique vocal style, which distinguished them clearly from the rest of the emerging Florida Death Metal bands; nowhere is this more apparent than on the prophetic title track of their debut.  The fact that Obituary refrained from printing lyric sheets with their albums led people to believe that they didn't actually write any lyrics. Some may question the verbosity or absence of documented lyrics, however, any true fan has each grunt, growl and howling grimace committed to memory like an utterance from God in painstaking form—what does not exist can not be remembered, and an Obituary show is testimony to the re-creation of what your ears couldn't believe in the first place. Once again bringing augmentation to irony, Live and Dead worked quite well for the quintet, dividing your conscience yet leaving much to the imagination; not since birth have your senses been so graphically assaulted yet pleased at the same time. While such differing sensations once seemed incongruous, Obituary have proven the ability to merge unlikely dichotomies, from their slow-as-hell-yet-fast-as-fuck style to the non-evil, homegrown approach to what would largely become the satanized, bastardized, make-up wearing movement known as Death Metal. \n\nThe maturation of the musicians into songwriters taking more visionary and complex forms would soon be heard world wide as Obituary took metal by storm in 1990. Despite their youth upon release of their sophomore offering, “Cause of Death” embodied the confident swagger of the most fearsome pack-leading hound. From the insidious growls of John’s vocals to the barrage of Donald Tardy’s thunderously-metered explosions of double bass, “Cause of Death” was the intention and method as promised by the early threat of “Slowly We Rot”; for Obituary, Death was just the beginning. Accordingly, the title track alone (“Cause of Death”) would be heard, regurgitated, manipulated, complimented and collapsed—but never duplicated—on third and forth generation death metal albums for years to come. Lovecraftian imagery and aural morbidity aside, even a deaf man found fear when confronted by the formidable visage of guitarist Peres; entering Frank Watkins, the hulking henchman of a bassist from South Florida, finally provided long-needed and powerful rhythm stability to the line up. However, the grinding of the axes would not be complete until the return of Xecutioner veteran Allen West, who, along with Peres and Tardy, crafted the foundation for most of Obituary’s most primordial and historic moments. Attack now whole, Obituary had given birth—sight, sound and feel—to a true horror greater than metal had ever known. \n\nThe paradox herein lies that Obituary was anything but a summation to and end, but more an exploratory journey into the infinite dehumanization of all that is known, as confronted brazenly by their best selling release yet, “The End Complete” and later followed by the cynical and dark expedition of “World Demise”. Reunited with songwriter West, the band was conjoined like quintuplets sharing life and a name. Though finality was possibly inferred by these titles, Obituary was anything but finished.  Ironically, the images conjured by songs such as “Don’t Care”, “Platonic Disease” and “World Demise” seemingly foretold of the millennium as can now be seen daily, displayed plainly across the screens of CNN and reality TV programs world wide; not bad for a bunch of rednecks from Florida with Budweiser dreams and bongwater nightmares. \n\n2004 brings reason for Obituary fans to rejoice, the sunken eyes and heaving cries have all but abated. Obituary has only aspired to live up to the standard they have set for themselves, one that numerous bands have strived to duplicate, but never attained, falling short both creatively and in lack of the unique talent that each member contributes to the near indescribable Obituary sound. Like a forgotten corpse in the basement, Obituary are back to haunt, taunt and fully pollute your senses. Fermenting like waste in the hot Florida sun, Obituary return from hiatus with the voracity of a starven wretch. The forfeiture of time brings blessings of brutality, and assurance that the Dead shall indeed rise again.  Such aural abrasion can only be heard on an Obituary album or the live circumcision of a thirty-year-old man, the choice is yours...\n \n   \n    \n","booking_agent":"Obituary","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150810477700957","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/294990_10150810477700957_1654892529_n.jpg","offset_y":82,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Gibsonton, Florida","general_manager":"Obituary","genre":"Florida Death Metal","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Brandon, Florida","influences":"Celtic Frost, Venom, Slayer, Savatage, Nasty Savage, Hellhammer,etc..","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":97213,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/ObituaryBand","name":"Obituary band","press_contact":"daveallison@obituary.cc","record_label":"Gibtown Records","talking_about_count":6208,"username":"ObituaryBand","website":"www.obituary.cc","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"The Split Band","id":"158035314272546","info":{"id":"158035314272546","about":"ฟังเพลง Split ได้ที่ http://www.deezer.com/en/artist/435409 ","app_id":"0","band_members":"Fame : Vocal\nSo : Guitarist\nKen : Guitarist\nNew : Drumer/Chorus \nMart : Bass guitarist","bio":"Split","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":470236003052474,"source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/s720x720/428488_470236003052474_2055650228_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"S.W.S","description":"Split","general_manager":"Green","genre":"pop","has_added_app":false,"influences":"Split !!","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":207410,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/thesplitband","name":"The Split Band","record_label":"Kamikze,  RS CO.,LTD","talking_about_count":6187,"username":"thesplitband","website":"http://www.ilovekamikaze.com http://www.deezer.com/en/artist/435409 ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"ZIVILIA BAND","id":"110476975653027","info":{"id":"110476975653027","about":"Zivilia Fanpage","app_id":"0","band_members":"Zul_Vocal, Piano & Guitar\n\n\n\nIdham  (Bass)\nIdham Terlam(Idham Terlam)\n\n\nOBOT -","bio":"Zivilia Band memulai kiprah di dunia musik pada tanggal 8 Agustus 2008 di kota Kendari.

Como eram amigos e freqüentavam a mesma igreja, faziam de lá o local para seus ensaios e estudos. Como toda uma geração da época, eles também foram influenciados pelo rock'n roll. \n \n     Juntando-se eles a Marcelo Amorim (baixo) e Jorge Bruno (bateria), nascia o Resgate. A banda falava em suas letras de uma maneira simples a respeito da palavra de Deus através do Rock, o que para a época era uma agressão aos costumes religiosos.\n \n     O Resgate é praticamente o precursor do Rock da música Gospel no Brasil, além de manter a mesma formação desde o início. Durante toda sua trajetória, sem abrir mão do autêntico rock'n'roll, mesclou outras tendências em seus trabalhos, como baladas, canções românticas, louvor & adoração, além de estilos alternativos. Com o tempo, conseguiu amadurecer, sem envelhecer.\n \n     A prova da \"juventude\" da banda é a idade média da galera que freqüenta os shows até os dias de hoje: predominantemente teens e jovens abaixo de 30 anos.\n \n     Dentro de cada um dos seus \"shows\", com uma pregação nada ortodoxa, fala sobre a transformação que Deus faz na vida de quem crê, e ao longo de 21 anos de estrada muitos jovens tem encontrado sentido de viver através de Jesus. É aí que o nome \"RESGATE\" faz todo o sentido.\n \n      O primeiro trabalho foi um disco (\"bolachão\" de vinil, 33 rpm) lançado de forma independente em 1991.\n \n     Em 2002 veio o \"acréscimo oficial\" do tecladista e arranjador Dudu Borges à banda, ele que já vinha acompanhando a banda como convidado em shows.\n \n     Em 2006, após 8 CD's lançados, entra em cena o 9.º trabalho (\"Até eu envelhecer\"), na estréia deste lançamento, veio também à gravação ao vivo do 2.º DVD no \"Tom Brasil\" (em 10/07).\n\n    Sempre bem-humorados, e o humor é parte do cotidiano da banda, o grupo não dá sinais de envelhecimento, pelo contrário continua figurando entre as principais bandas do movimento Gospel no Brasil. O Resgate é contratada exclusiva da gravadora Sony Music. Toda a produção artística fica por conta da “Amplitude A Produções”.","booking_agent":"Amplitudea@gmail.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":565081420173253,"source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/65067_565081420173253_104126712_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"São Paulo","description":"Banda Resgate, formada por Zé Bruno, Hamilton Gomes, Marcelo Amorim e Jorge Bruno, é uma das principais banda de rock cristão do país.\n\nSão 23 anos de estrada falando do amor de Deus através do seu rock n´roll inteligente e divertido.

The band is a quartet composed of Eric Martin (vocals), Paul Gilbert (guitar), Billy Sheehan (bass), and Pat Torpey (drums); Mr. Big also included Richie Kotzen, a reputable blues-based guitarist who replaced Paul in 1999 when Paul decided to focus on a solo career. The band is noted especially for their \"shred guitar\" musicianship, intense live performances, and well-crafted songs.\n\nIdentified early on as a \"musicians' band\", Mr. Big was able to produce numerous hit songs that ranged across a wide array of rock genres, be it ballad, heavy metal, or blues rock. Prior to the formation of the group, each of the members already had a reputation of being virtuosos as well as established song-writers/ composers. Their songs were often marked with strong vocals and vocal harmonies, and a technical proficiency in all instruments. Their hits include \"To Be With You\" (Billboard Hot 100 number one single in 15 countries for weeks, in 1991), \"Wild World\", \"Green-Tinted Sixties Mind\", \"Just Take My Heart\", other ballads, and a host of heavy metal songs that were played mostly during their live performances, such as \"Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy\", \"Addicted to that Rush\", \"Colorado Bulldog\", and \"Take Cover\", among the rest.\n\nMr. Big's following and reputation remained strong for over two decades, despite the band being challenged by personal internal conflicts and the changing trends in mainstream music. Over the years, through the different heights of the band's career, the fan-base of the group has remained steadfast - even after the demise of the band in 2002. Fans have always asked for the band's reunion.\n\nIn February 2009, as a result of fan-demand and also after several coincidences over the past couple of years that have gradually brought the group back together again, Eric, Pat, Paul, and Billy finally announced their decision to reunite. This announcement was marked with celebration and excitement amongst fans all over the world, especially in Japan. The band members themselves are very happy to be together again as friends, and to perform once more for fans all over the world. Their first tour is in Japan in June 2009.\n\nIn September 2010, Mr. Big recorded their seventh album \"What IF...\"with producer Kevin Shirley at a Los Angeles-area studio.  The album was released in Japan on Dec. 15th, 2010, in Europe on Jan. 21st, 2011 and in the USA in Feb. 2011. \"What If... is the first studio album in nearly 10 years. The band also toured in support of the album. The \"Around the World\" tour to support the album kicked off at The House of Blues, in Hollywood, CA on April 2, 2011 and ended at Makassar, Indonesia on December 10, 2011.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n    * Mr. Big (1989) (The Billboard 200 #46, Japan Oricon Album Chart #22, JPN - Gold)\n    * Lean Into It (1991) (The Billboard 200 #15, Japan Oricon Album Chart #6, US - Platinum, JPN - Platinum)\n    * Bump Ahead (1993) (The Billboard 200 #82, Japan Oricon Album Chart #4, JPN - Platinum)\n    * Hey Man (1996) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #1, JPN - 2x Platinum)\n    * Get Over It (2000) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #5, JPN - Gold)\n    * Actual Size (2001) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #5)\n    * What If (2010)\n\nLive albums\n\n    * Raw Like Sushi (1990) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #32)\n    * Mr. Big Live (Live in San Francisco) (1992) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #45)\n    * Raw Like Sushi II (1992) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #8, JPN - Gold)\n    * Japandemonium: Raw Like Sushi 3 (1994) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #11, JPN - Platinum)\n    * Channel V at the Hard Rock Live (1996) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #32)\n    * Live at Budokan (1997) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #20)\n    * In Japan (2002) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #12)\n    * Live at the Hard Rock Cafe (2007)\n    * Back to Budokan (2009)\n    * Live From the Living Room (2011 in Japan; 2012 in North America & Europe)\n    * Raw Like Sushi 100 (2012 in Japan)\n\nSingles\n\n    * Addicted to That Rush (1989) (Mainstream Rock Tracks #39)\n    * Green-Tinted Sixties Mind (1991) (Mainstream Rock Tracks #33)\n    * To Be With You (1992) (The Billboard Hot 100 #1 (3 weeks), Mainstream Rock Tracks #19, Adult Contemporary #11)\n    * Just Take My Heart (1992) (The Billboard Hot 100 #16, Mainstream Rock Tracks #18, Japan Oricon Single Chart #68)\n    * Wild World (1993) (The Billboard Hot 100 #27, Mainstream Rock Tracks #33, Top 40 Mainstream #12, Japan Oricon Single Chart #40)\n    * Ain't Seen Love Like That (1994) (The Billboard Hot 100 #83)\n    * Take Cover (1996) (Japan Oricon Single Chart #1)\n    * Not One Night (1997)\n    * Superfantastic (2000) (Japan Oricon Single Chart #97)\n    * Static (2000) (Japan Oricon Single Chart #66)\n    * Where Are They Now (2000) (Japan Oricon Single Chart #47)\n    * Shine (2001) (Japan Oricon Single Chart #1)\n    * Arrow (2001) (Japan Oricon Single Chart #42)\n    * Undertow (2010)\n\nCompilations\n\n    * Big Bigger Biggest: Greatest Hits (1996) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #2, JPN - 4x Platinum)\n    * Deep Cuts (2000) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #12)\n    * Greatest Hits (2004) (Japan Oricon Album Chart #70)","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150766090297150","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/533006_10150766090297150_550269043_n.jpg","offset_y":6,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"USA","genre":"Hard Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"USA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":134617,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/MrBigBand","name":"Mr Big (band)","record_label":"Frontiers Records - Worldwide; WHD Entertainment - Japan ","talking_about_count":5312,"username":"MrBigBand","website":"http://www.mrbigsite.com/ http://www.mrbigforum.info/ http://www.mrbig-band.com/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Calypso","id":"345725693654","info":{"id":"345725693654","about":"\"É essa guitarra galera que faz o sucesso da nossa música paraense.

Rolling Stone magazine ranked them alongside such artists as U2 and the Stones in its list of Top 10 Must-See Artists in the summer of 2007. They earned $2.5 million—a staggering total for a still-developing act—on the tour circuit in a single year. Willie Nelson, the Eagles, Gary Allan and Dierks Bentley all picked them as opening acts for their concerts. And more than 2,200 people showed up and bought the bands album at an appearance at Wherehouse Music.\n\nThe fans’ exuberance was shared by USA Today, which praised the band for having “loads of grit, swagger and heart.”\n\nThe Randy Rogers Band built its audience by combining forces: It’s a dynamic live act centered around songs that fit the rowdy, party vibe of the concert circuit, but their songs also say something.\n\nThat’s particularly true in the new album, The Randy Rogers Band, in which a dozen persuasive tracks give the listener plenty of reasons to want to down a celebratory brewski. But the songs also maintain a depth that makes them powerful and provocative even beyond their edgy arrangements and tough-guy sound.\n\nInvariably, the songs are about people making choices and dealing with the consequences they bring. That’s the case in the opening “Wicked Ways,” in which a string of wild endeavors leaves an out-of-control adult in need of redemption. It’s true in “When The Circus Leaves Town,” where a performer comes to terms with the emotional crash that accompanies the conclusion of a pumped-up show. It’s even a tenet in “One Woman,” a ballad that finds a former playboy recognizing his old choices and behaviors were a shallow pursuit next to the promise and solidity that stand before him.\n\n“These songs are definitely true, and they’re relatable to many different life situations that I’ve either gone through in the past or will go through in the future,” Rogers, the lead singer and primary songwriter, says. “I just tried to create believable characters and relatable characters. I hear from fans that we really have helped them in real-life situations when they’ve applied the songs to their everyday life. That’s what I strive for in the songs that I write.”\n\n“We’re not old, but we are getting a little bit more mature,” bass player Jon Richardson asserts, drawing laughter from the rest of the band. “We’re trying to be more mature, anyway. And that’s something that we can write about a little more naturally now instead of ‘Here’s a song about how much fun I had’ or ‘Here’s a song about a girl.’ That’s probably just a natural progression of our own lives being reflected in our songs.”\n\nIndeed, the Randy Rogers Band is confronting the same questions about relationships and identity that face many of the college students and young adults that form the centerpiece of the group’s audience. The balancing act between work, home and recreation is a difficult one—even tougher for an ensemble that spends more than 200 days annually on the road.\n\n“All the guys, except for Jon, are married or soon to be married,” guitarist Geoffrey Hill observes. “Les [drummer] and I both have kids. So sometimes it feels like you’ve really gotta struggle to fit all that into your life, I guess, but it’s kinda part of the game. I always said that I play music for free, and I get paid to leave the family behind and go on the road.”\n\nThat requires a constant rededication to the group, a commitment the five members have repeatedly made since the current lineup coalesced in 2003. \n\n","booking_agent":"Henry Glascock - WME Nashville","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151227032896505","source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/s720x720/297256_10151227032896505_1590943423_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Country","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"San Marcos, Texas","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":346993,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/RandyRogersBand","name":"Randy Rogers Band","press_contact":"Heather Bohn","record_label":"MCA Nashville","talking_about_count":5154,"username":"RandyRogersBand","website":"http://www.randyrogersband.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Adista BAND","id":"400389586668420","info":{"id":"400389586668420","about":"Official Fanpage Adista Band.

The video of the single mero aasu from the debut album, witnessed a country wide popularity surge within a week of its official release. This success gave the band a much needed break into the mainstream music industry in Nepal. The album included other hits like jeewan mero, pagal nabhana, and numberous jams and rehearsals, Jeewan connected with three talented seasoned musicians in Pokhara. They shared similar views, attitude, and taste for the music they envisioned haheyko.\n\nThis state of halcyon didn’t last long. In just a few years, the band found itself in a deep crossroads. With other priorities vying against the commitment to continue making music it became obvious that the original lineup would falter. The disbanding became the inevitable reality.\n\nThe hiatus that followed the disbanding, front-man Jeewan continued with his singing. The incessant passion proved to be a rewarding experience. In 2003, through to create.\n\nThe new lineup is perhaps the most talented ever. Emerging from a deep hiatus the band cut their second album Vibes with Vajra Records in 2006. The album contains some of the most intelligent originals the band has in its credit till date. Recorded and mastered at Sacred Sound Studio, Kathmandu, Vibes showcases the band’s technical prowess, endurance, and lyrical maturity. thaha chaina, an orchestral arrangement; shanti ko sandesh, a hard rock with patriotic theme; kasailai, a steady rock groove; bhramma, an alternative experiment; ballads, jiuna lai garo and duukha diyera; and soothing prastab and lekhiyeka shabda demonstrate the cohesion amidst diversity in composition.\n\nAfter the release of the video for thaha chaina on major television channels, The Edge’s popularity spread far and wide. Since the album release, the band has played some dozen shows in their hometown Pokhara. They have played numerous sold-outs including charities and festivals. Their concerts are popular for a flawless performance and a powerful stage presence.\n\nThus far, The Edge has received couple awards and nominations. The song Duukha diyera bagged the best lyrics award at the Pokhara Music Award. The song received critical acclaim for its soulful words. In 2006, following the release of Vibes, The Edge was nominated at the 9th Tuborg Annual Image Awards in the category of Rock Vocal Performance. Although it was only confined to nominations, The Edge has come out of age to demonstrate their ability to deliver beyond anyone’s expectation. Currently, the band is working on the new materials. They are often seen playing live around town and in their own oxygen lounge bar in Lakeside.

Borden - Drums \nChris Hicks - Guitar, Vocals\nRick Willis - Guitar, Vocals","bio":"In the early fall of 1973 The Marshall Tucker Band was still a young and hungry group out to prove themselves every time they hit the stage.  Their debut album had already spawned numerous hits. The band’s recent release of their Greatest Hits album, in traditional vinyl form, is a time capsule from that period.  “We were a bunch of young guys who didn’t know any boundaries” says founding member and longtime lead singer Doug Gray.  As it turned out, the collective talents of The Marshall Tucker Band took them very far indeed.  More than four decades later, the new vinyl Greatest Hits release takes us back to the early years of The Marshall Tucker Band, both literally and physically.\n\nStill led today by founding member and lead singer Doug Gray, they represent a time and place in music that will never be duplicated.  Gray is quick to credit the band's current dynamic members with carrying on the timeless essence of the Marshall Tucker Band sound. Current members include the highly respected drummer B.B. Borden, a former member of both Mother's Finest and The Outlaws, multi instrumentalist Marcus Henderson of Macon, Georgia, plays flute, saxophone and keyboards in addition to lead and background vocals, Pat Elwood on bass guitar, and Rick Willis on lead guitar and vocals, both of Spartanburg SC, are disciples of the Caldwell Brothers.  Acclaimed lead guitarist and vocalist Chris Hicks recently rejoined the band after a two-year absence.  Together they present a powerful stage presence as they continue to tour the country and continue to be powerful force in the world of music. \n\nThe Marshall Tucker Band got its start in Spartanburg, S.C. when Gray teamed up with Tommy Caldwell and Toy Caldwell, Paul T. Riddle, George McCorkle and Jerry Eubanks, borrowing the name \"Marshall Tucker\" from a piano tuner whose name was found on a key ring in their old rehearsal space. In 1972, they signed with Capricorn Records, the same label that guided The Allman Brothers Band, Wet Willie, and others to national fame. The MTB opened shows for The Allman Brothers in 1973, and the following year, they began to headline their own shows across America due to the platinum-plus sales of their debut album.  They toured constantly playing sheds, stadiums, theaters, fairs, and festivals.\n\nIn years to come, The Marshall Tucker Band would wow critics and influence major country acts like Alabama, The Kentucky Headhunters, Confederate Railroad, and Travis Tritt with its definitive blend of rock, rhythm & blues, jazz, country, and gospel. Now, thanks to the expanding scope of today's music, a new generation of fans is learning what the rest of their fans have known for so long- that good music knows no boundaries.  Along the way, the band has recorded twenty two studio albums, three DVDs, three live albums and many compilations.\n\nIn 1980 Tommy Caldwell died as a result of injuries from an auto accident.  In 1984 Toy Caldwell, George McCorkle, and Paul Riddle decided to retire.  Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks with the blessings of the other three continued to record and perform as the Marshall Tucker Band.  1n 1993 Toy Caldwell, who wrote the majority of their songs, passed away, as did George McCorkle in 2007.  Jerry Eubanks retired in 1996 and Doug Gray continues to lead the current band of fine musicians winning new young fans as well as satisfying the loyal fans of several generations.\n\nYears of rigorous tour schedules earned the band the respect of critics and countless dedicated fans. With hit singles like \"Heard It In a Love Song,\" \"Fire On The Mountain,\" \"Can't You See,\" and \"Take The Highway,\" The Marshall Tucker Band earned seven gold and three platinum albums while they were on the Capricorn Records label. During the 90's, the MTB scored four hit singles on Billboard's country chart and one on Billboard's gospel chart. Their music has also been featured on the soundtracks of movies such as Smokey and the Bandit, Blow, The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper, Shipwrecked, Crank 2, Don’t Mess with Zohan, Stop Loss, Swing Vote, Taking Chance and many others as well as many TV Shows.\n\n“The buying public never really cared whether we were country or rock and roll\" says Gray. \"They called us a Southern rock band, but we have always played everything from country, jazz, blues, Rock & Roll and all things in-between. As we've become older,\" Gray grins, eyes twinkling, \"our Southern heritage seems to come out even more. But no matter how old we get, we can still rock your socks off.\"  Gray also notes that people have gotten \"married and buried\" to classic MTB songs like \"Desert Skies\" and \"Can't You See\". After 40 years, The Marshall Tucker Band continues to be played on classic rock and country radio, and they have never stopped touring.\n\nToday the band records on its own RAMBLIN’ RECORDS Label which is distributed by SONY by way of a joint venture with SHOUT! FACTORY and continues to record new material and continues to regularly tour the country to the delight of their fans, old and new.\n\nThe Marshall Tucker Band is:\nDoug Gray – Lead Vocals\nChris Hicks – Lead & Slide Guitar / Vocals\nPat Elwood– Bass Guitar\nRick Willis – Lead Guitars / Vocals\nB.B.

Siendo todavía un niño, en su natal Mesillas, pueblo ubicado en el municipio de Concordia, Sin., manifestó su pasión por la música, ya que en casi todas las actividades que realizaba se la pasaba tarareando las melodías que escuchaba en radio.\n\nROBERTO JUNIOR cumplió con los mandatos de sus padres de terminar los estudios básicos, pero fue cuando cursaba la universidad decidió dejar los estudios y se empeñó en entrar a una banda. Luego de algún tiempo se le presentó su primera oportunidad con una banda local, lo invitaron a hacer una audición, y para su sorpresa logro quedarse como vocalista de la agrupación.\n\nGracias a su gran carisma y simpatía con la gente, logro concretar diversos proyectos musicales en diferentes agrupaciones muy reconocidas dentro del ámbito de música sinaloense las cuales le brindaron un aprendizaje y madurez musical.\n\nTras su paso por estas agrupaciones en octubre del 2008, este joven intérprete decidió emprender su propio proyecto musical, al cual denominó ROBERTO JUNIOR Y SU BANDEÑO; genero enfocado a norteño-banda o “bandeño”, en donde la música se distingue por sus instrumentos básicos que son la tuba (banda) y el acordeón (norteño), además de la batería y la guitarra de 12 cuerdas y con lo cual vio cristalizado uno de sus sueños y así cumplir sus diferentes inquietudes.\n\nAsí, de manera independiente realiza su primer disco dentro del género norteño-banda titulado ELLOS NO IMAGINAN, el cual cuenta con los arreglos musicales de ROBERTO JUNIOR y Martín López y contiene 10 canciones, con el logra seducir al público, no sólo con su voz, sino también con su sensibilidad para escribir. ROBERTO JUNIOR Y SU BANDEÑO empezó a conocer el éxito gracias al tema “Ellos no imaginan”, con el cual comenzaron a sonar y a trabajar a nivel nacional.\n\nSu segundo sencillo titulado “El guayabo”, tuvo una gran difusión en radio y televisión, siendo este tema con el que la gente lo comenzó a identificar y hasta lo apodaron igual que la canción. El tercer corte promocional que dio a conocer fue “Quiero más de ti”, canción que poco a poco agarró fuerza hasta convertirse en favorita de la gente.\n\nROBERTO se considera un cantante versátil, con un estilo musical que aún no es muy conocido en gran parte del país. Sincero, como es él, ROBERTO JUNIOR reconoce que su carrera no ha sido nada facil; más bien todo ha sido cuestión de agallas.\n\nAhora bajo la dirección del productor musical FERNANDO CAMACHO, en el mes de Agosto del 2010, ROBERTO JUNIOR lanzo su nuevo disco titulado CHICO POPULAR, el cual está compuesto por 11 temas llenos de sentimiento y energía, en donde de nueva cuenta deja al descubierto su faceta como un gran compositor, este nuevo disco ha logrado que el joven intérprete del norteño banda, tenga varios éxitos rápidamente ya que su primer sencillo TAMALES DE CHIVO, logro colocarse en el gusto del público y ha sido todo un éxito por ser uno de los temas más solicitados en las estaciones radiales en México.","booking_agent":"Frank Valdez","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":528352827211060,"source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/21222_528352827211060_713467859_n.jpg","offset_y":93,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Mazatlan, Sinaloa Mexico.","description":"Oficinas en Mazatlan, Sinaloa Mexico\n Tels: (669) 9 90 30 50 al 52\n","general_manager":"Lic.

Dengan adanya additional Drummer Alsa, kini SETIA BAND tampil lebih fresh dan fun tanpa meninggalkan karakternya sebagai band pop-me...\nlayu. Selain itu, SETIA BAND mempunyai konsep selalu memasukkan unsur budaya Indonesia di setiap penampilan mereka : tarian daerah, alat-alat musik daerah, kostum, dll. Di kota dan daerah manapun SETIA BAND tampil, pasti akan selalu membawa unsur budaya daerah tersebut ke atas panggung bersama mereka.\n\nJudul album perdana SETIA BAND diambil dari motto mereka \"SATU HATI\". Masih dengan nuansa pop melayu, SETIA BAND hadir dengan materi lagu yang lebih berwarna. Tanpa ada kata-kata dan kalimat kiasan, lagu-lagu SETIA BAND di album SATU HATI secara tegas dan sederhana mengungkapkan maknanya. \"Untuk menyatukan hati kita semua, satu dalam kasih sayang, selalu menebarkan cinta kepada sesama, rasa saling menghormati dan toleransi. Insya Allah pesan Satu Hati ini dapat membawa keindahan hidup bila kita semua berusaha mewujudkannya\".\n\nAlbum SATU HATI didistribusikan secara exclusive melalui INDOMARET, terhitung sejak pertengahan April 2012. Dengan jaringan lebih dari 6.300 gerai sampai ke pelosok tanah air akan memudahkan penggemar SETIA BAND yang juga konsumen INDOMARET mendapatkan CD album SATU HATI. Belum di luncurkan, CD album SATU HATI telah terjual 1.200 keping dalam waktu 7 hari di INDOMARET...  \n\n\nDalam kamus SETIA BAND SETIAKU, (MERAH PUTIH BIRU) bukan bendera negara tapi sebuah simbolik suatu komitmen\n\n1.

PUTIH : sebagai simbol kesucian anak SETIAKU yang selalu mendukung SETIA BAND tetapi anak SETIAKU juga tidak lupa dengan sang pencipta\n\n3. BIRU : sebagai simbol kedamaian, anak SETIAKU cinta damai dengan fans fans group band lain maupun saudaranya sendiri\n\nMERAH, PUTIH, BIRU itu berbeda warna tapi SATU TUJUAN, SATU IMPIAN, SATU HARAPAN untuk selalu mendukung SETIA BAND. . .","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Makassar","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":16181,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/SetiakuSatuHatiFansSetiaBand","name":"Setiaku Satu Hati (Fans Setia BAND)","talking_about_count":4202,"username":"SetiakuSatuHatiFansSetiaBand","website":"http://www.setiaband.com, www.facebook.com/SetiakuSatuHatiFansSetiaBand","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"SIN BANDERAS","id":"24218246108","info":{"id":"24218246108","about":"\"Las palabras son gratitud, emoción y felicidad de poder cerrar el ciclo en un momento donde el grupo todavía goza de una salud y una aceptación maravillosa con el público. \"","app_id":"0","band_members":"Noel Schajris Rodríguez\nLeonel García","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151102607046109","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/21882_10151102607046109_417731832_n.jpg","offset_y":60,"offset_x":0},"genre":"pop ","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":1595695,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/SIN-BANDERAS/24218246108","name":"SIN BANDERAS","talking_about_count":4008,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Bauhaus","id":"109194179106090","info":{"id":"109194179106090","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"Bauhaus were an English gothic rock band, formed in Northampton in 1978. The group consisted of Peter Murphy (vocals), Daniel Ash (guitar), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass guitar). The band was originally named \"Bauhaus 1919\" before they dropped the numerical portion within a year of formation. With their dark and gloomy sound and image, Bauhaus are generally considered the first gothic rock group.Bauhaus first broke up in 1983. Peter Murphy began a solo career while Ash and Haskins continued as Tones on Tail and, later, reunited with David J to form Love and Rockets. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. The band reunited for a 1998 tour and again from 2005–2008.HistoryDaniel Ash, his friend David J. Haskins and Haskins' younger brother Kevin had played together in various bands since childhood. One of the longer-lived of these was a band called The Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Peter Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought he had the right look for a band. Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided to give it a try, despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song \"In the Flat Field\".Ash's old bandmate Kevin Haskins joined as the drummer. Ash made a point of not inviting David J, the driving force in their previous bands, because he wanted a band he could control. After only a few weeks though, Ash reconsidered and invited Haskins to replace original bassist Chris Barber. Haskins had already agreed to tour American airbases with another band, but decided that joining his friends' group was \"the right thing to do\". With their line-up complete, the unnamed band played their first gig at the Cromwell pub in Wellingborough on New Year's Eve 1978.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":243046,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bauhaus/109194179106090","name":"Bauhaus","talking_about_count":3997,"website":"http://www.bauhausmusik.com/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"WALI BAND","id":"118270987889","info":{"id":"118270987889","about":"Wali Band adalah grup musik bergenre Lokal Pop Kreatif yang dibentuk pada 31 Oktober 1999, dengan personel terdiri dari Faank (vokal), Apoy (gitar), Tomi (drum), Ovie ((keyboard & synt), dan Nunu (bass).","app_id":"0","band_members":"-Farhan ZM (Faank) : vokal\n-Aan Kurnia (Apoy) : gitar\n-Ihsan Bustomi (Tomie) : drum\n-Hamzah Shopi (Ovie) : keyboard","bio":"Wali Band merupakan grup musik asal Blora yang berdomisili di Kapuk,Cengkareng.

Formed in Liverpool in the early 90's, the band's musical vision has continually evolved over the ensuing years while always remaining true to their original goal of creating forward thinking, meaningful, passionate and honest music. With each release they move beyond the boundaries of limited scenes and pigeon holes, creating a complex and emotive atmospheric sound.\nCountless world tours have built up a very loyal international fan base and the \"Natural Disaster\" tour saw them playing hundreds of shows in over 30 countries.\nThe line-up is really a collective of two families, who were quite simply born to play music. Anathema consists of brothers Vincent, Daniel and Jamie Cavanagh, alongside childhood friends John Douglas and his sister Lee, who is an incredible singer in her own right. The line-up is completed by Les Smith, who beings much in the way of production expertise to the band. There is a deep bond in the group that transcends usual band politics, ego and avarice. They have a shared vision and are about to take the band to a whole new level. Anathema are currently working on an album of brand new material.

The Moonshine Bandits’ intoxicating musical mixture of hip-hop and country won over fans of different genres as their new album simultaneously hit Billboard’s Rap chart at No. 44, Current Country chart at No. 65, and the Independent albums chart at No. 162. Take 1 shot of Johnny Cash influence, 1 shot of the Beastie Boys influence and a dash of dancing girls, and you've got the unconventional new duo, the Moonshine Bandits.  \n\nThe Bandits have toured Nationally, recorded or performed with established artists such as Uncle Kracker, David Allan Coe, REHAB, TECHN9NE, Kottonmouth Kings, Everlast, Pepper, N2Deep, Twiztid, Boondox, Haystak, Vanilla Ice, Expendables, E-40 and the list goes on. Moonshine Bandits songs “Sweet Home California” , “Moonshine” featuring Danny Boone from the group REHAB (Sittin’ at a Bar song), and “Super Goggles” have all received Radio Airplay on FM Top 40 Stations in various regions.  The Moonshine Bandits are definitely the working man's champion and continue to earn their stripes in a tough industry.  The Bandits endorse their own brand of Liquor beverage called \"Moonshine Bandits Outlaw Moonshine\" The 99 proof spirit sold in regional grocery/liquor stores and online at www.outlawshine.com. One of the reasons Tex and Bird became known as the Moonshine Bandits is because of Tex's deep family roots of bootlegging booze during the Prohibition years.  Tex's great grandfather used a barber shop as a front while he peddled alcohol illegally in baby carriages to community members, family, friends and politicians.  This all took place in Northern California during the years of the Great Depression.  \n\nThe Bandits have earned a ton of industry credits with music placed in Extreme Sports DVDs, 4x4 DVD's, and close to 1,000 live shows performed.  \nMoonshine Bandits have performed in Biker Clubhouses where most Police Departments wouldn’t even step foot in, Smoke Filled Dive Bars, Biker Bars, Clubs, Harley Davidson Events, Cage Fighting Events, 4x4 Mud Conventions, Beer Festivals, Music Venues, and just about every other type of venue you can imagine. The ultimate honor was receiving a phone call from the United States Military to perform at Fort Irwin, CA. The Moonshine Bandits performed on July 4, 2010 at the Fort Irwin Military Base located in the Mojave Desert for thousands of our U.S. Troops. Their Live performances rival many of today’s mega super stars. Their show consists of backup singer Derrty D, Award Winning DJ ChopStiqs, Shiner Girl Dancer Kristin aka Firecracker, their drummer B. Diddy and a lifted 4 x 4 Limo. If the Bandits are in your town, be ready for a Hell Raisin’ Good ol’ Time! \n\nAs the Moonshine Bandits gained momentum and their fan base started spreading outside of California to different states, and to Japan, Canada, Sweden, and troops stationed overseas, SHINER NATION WAS BUILT. Shiner Nation was formed to unite all the Moonshine Bandits fans. The Definition of a Shiner is a Rowdy Individual commonly known as a Moonshine Bandit Fan. Living the Shiner Lifestyle isn’t just about the music, it’s also about partying it up and raising hell your own way. You only live once.  The Bandits Musical foundation was built with a blue collar approach from the ground up.  Their success is truely a result of hard work and doing things “their” way.  \n\n\n ","booking_agent":"Buddy Lee Nashville - Anthony Wozniak - awozniak@blanash.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151343578266082","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/600757_10151343578266082_364253120_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":40},"current_location":"CALIFORNIA","general_manager":"F3 Entertainment - KEN MADSON -  ken@F3Entertainment.com","genre":"Cali Country ","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"CALIFORNIA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":43731,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/moonshinebandits","name":"Moonshine Bandits","press_contact":"PUBLICIST: James Wright - james@kerosenemedia.com","record_label":"SUBURBAN NOIZE RECORDS","talking_about_count":3517,"username":"moonshinebandits","website":"www.moonshinebandits.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"banda ms","id":"194207570620481","info":{"id":"194207570620481","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":194577,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/banda-ms/194207570620481","name":"banda ms","talking_about_count":3493,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Carrossel","id":"281810535273313","info":{"id":"281810535273313","about":"Official // ¹ Criada // Outras com o mesmo nome é plágio \nNÃO SOMOS NINGUÉM DE CARROSSEL \nDono: Júnior // Sub: Pablo // CDC: Nick, André , Bruna e Rozária\n","app_id":"0","band_members":"Kokimoto –Jaime – Carmen – Alícia – Daniel –Valéria e Maria Joaquina – Cirilo e Laura ","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":369320013189031,"source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/184582_369320013189031_674955965_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":11529,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Banda-Carrossel/281810535273313","name":"Banda Carrossel","talking_about_count":3424,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"LyLA Band","id":"51474476172","info":{"id":"51474476172","about":"LYLA is a poprock band from Indonesia.","affiliation":"Music","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"oasis,Lifehouse,the script,one republic,Sheilaon7","band_members":"Naga(vocalist)\nAmec(Drummer)\nFare(Guitarist)\nDennis(Bassist)\nDharma(keyboardist)","birthday":"07/01/2006","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151386358591173","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/733758_10151386358591173_914146786_n.jpg","offset_y":19,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Jakarta,Pekanbaru","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":335543,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/LYLAFANSCLUB","location":{"street":"Jl.

Due to his vocal range, stage presence, good looks, and uncanny ability to mimic popular artists, Kees quickly created a buzz and attracted a large, loyal following. On the crest of all this success and momentum, Kees exited the cover band circuit in 2005 and formed his own band, KES, with the dream to pursue great original music. Featuring his brothers Hans (drums), Jon (lead guitar), and best friend Riad Boochoon (bass), Kees was now able to work with similarly focused members on creating original music that could have international appeal.\n\nSince branching out on their own, Kes (the band) has managed to achieve significant success on a worldwide scale! For starters, the band has released several albums, (Three Baldheads & a Dread, Lion and On in Five), with more than a dozen tracks making it into the top 10 of major Caribbean charts. Additionally the band has won numerous awards for songwriting; toured globally, performed at major festivals and events in the United States, Canada and Germany; opened for acts such as Sean Paul, Musiq Soul Child, Usher, John Legend, and Rihanna; and had their music featured on television shows broadcast on MTV and BET, as well as licensed tracks to popular games on major video game platforms. \n\nIn November 2007 Kees was flown to Nashville Tennessee to work with multiple Grammy Award Winner Desmond Child.  The song he co-wrote with Child was recorded by American Idol Ace Young and is featured on his self title album\n\nKes recently cut tracks with Maxi Priest and Aftermath signed artiste Bishop Lamont.  These are due for release later this year.  At the 2009 LA ASCAP Conference Kes was selected out of hundreds to perform at the showcase and left everyone clamoring to meet them.\n\nKes the band’s unique blend of soulful vocals and calypso-inspired melodies, over a fusion of rock riffs and island beats, hints of soca and reggae, can best be described as Caribbean Pop. This style has elevated Kes to stardom, allowing the band to become a household name in Trinidad & Tobago and throughout the Caribbean circuit including Miami, New York, Los Angeles, but also garnering attention from the mainstream market, where they consistently win over audiences with their electric and high-energy performances! \n\nThe band recently wrapped three music videos for songs off their new Album; The songs are Stalker, My Girl and Till the Morning.  All three were Directed and Produced by a team comprising of Actor , Director and Writer Ty Hodges (Holes, Even Stevens,) Photographer and Director of Photography, Eric Curtis (www.ericcurtisphotography.com ) and Sheldon Felix, one of the top Trinidadian editors and Directors.\n\n\nFor more information check out: \nwww.myspace.com/kestheband\nManagement information: Question Mark Entertainment cpasea@questionmarkent.com\n\n","booking_agent":"Question Mark Entertainment - 1 868 353 - 7000 or for Festival or College Bookings (US, Latin America, Europe & Asia)  Contact Arturo Martinez:-  E-Mail: arturo@TheRelentlessAgency.com/ Phone: 347-269-8130","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151610709664653","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/923006_10151610709664653_357755930_n.jpg","offset_y":3,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Trinidad","description":"Are you with me ?\nCan you hear me ?\nAre you with me , Can you hear me ?

A Grafith, composta pelos quatro irmãos João Batista - conhecidos como Joãozinho, Luís Cláudio (Kaká), Júnior e Carlinhos -, possui marca registrada tanto no Rio Grande do Norte como em outros estados do Nordeste e vem conquistando fãs em grandes cidades e interiores com sucesso estável, bem como vem mantendo fielmente seus seguidores.\nA carreira musical da família iniciou-se ainda na infância, quando Joãozinho resolveu \"escapar\" da severidade imposta pela educação militar do pai para expressar seu talento e paixão pela música. Passou a tocar guitarra e logo estava em contato com sua primeira experiência em apresentações musicais. Teve uma passagem rápida na banda Infernais, formado no bairro das Quintas, e logo se firmou na The Shinys como guitarrista e cantor, em 1974.\n\nCom o despertar musical de Joãozinho, os outros irmãos, que também possuíam interesse pela música, decidiram seguir seus passos, sempre sendo questionados pelo pai, que tinha dúvidas se a música traria algum futuro e retorno financeiro para eles. Segundo os irmãos, o maior medo do pai era que os filhos acabassem possuindo algum vício, muito comum ao ambiente musical, o que não aconteceu.\n\nApós a saída de Joãozinho do The Shinys, Luís Claúdio de Lima, o Kaká, foi chamado para substituir o irmão. Joãozinho passou a integrar o Suigeneris, com shows no Estado de São Paulo.\n\nEnquanto o precursor Joãozinho se apresentava em programas de televisão, como o do Chacrinha, do Raul Gil, Clube do Bolinha e outros em São Paulo com o Suigeneres, seus irmãos Júnior, Kaká e Carlinhos integravam a banda os Impossíveis, começando, assim, a junção que formaria a futura banda que é sucesso até os dias de hoje.\n\nQuando Joãozinho voltou a Natal em 1981, recusou o convite do Skema Livre e se juntou aos irmãos e o contrabaixista Jaílson na banda os Impossíveis. Essa nova formação durou até 1987 e, com sua ruptura, surgiu a Banda Grafith.\n\nA banda recém-surgida mantinha o estilo de banda baile e, assim, conquistou fãs que se denominam \"nação grafitheira\". Novos ritmos foram aderidos, e a banda logo ficou reconhecida por sua diversidade, capacidade de adequação aos mais diversos ambientes - tocando em eventos como formaturas, casamentos, festas, carnaval e shows – e variedade de repertório. Por onde passa, Grafith arrasta multidões, sendo considerada banda \"da massa\", de todos os gostos e todas as classes sociais.\n\nCom 23 anos de carreira, o grupo tem grande consideração e contato com seus fãs, além de manter sempre a humildade e o contato e apoio dos amigos e familiares, proporcionando, assim, o reconhecimento e o sucesso.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":512299025477793,"source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/17529_512299025477793_578157409_n.jpg","offset_y":62,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Natal/RN","description":"Banda Baile com 24 Anos de Sucesso!\nSiga a Banda no Twitter:  @GrafithOficial\n","general_manager":"Junior Grafith","genre":"Banda Baile","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Natal/RN","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":35780,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/BandaGrafithOficial","name":"Banda Grafith Oficial","press_contact":"marketingbandagrafith@gmail.com","release_date":"03/11/1988","talking_about_count":3214,"username":"BandaGrafithOficial","website":"http://www.bandagrafithrn.com.br/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Lexington Band","id":"126857451707","info":{"id":"126857451707","about":"Official Fan Page grupe Lexington","app_id":"0","band_members":"Bojan Vasković, Miloš Vuksanović, Filip Krvavac, Dragoljub Stević, Dejan Krstić","bio":"Grupa Lexington počela je sa radom 2004. godine u Beogradu.

A main concern from the group, besides music, has always been the audience interaction in order to eliminate the stage-audience barrier, therefore the interdisciplinary side (performance, sketch) and the visual language (circus characterization), are an essential part of the show, making the streets their main improvisation and learning laboratory. Despite their short career they've been performing in a wide variety of venues (theaters, cultural centers, festivals, auditoriums, etc.), alternating with world-renowned artists. \n\nTriciclo Circus Band est un groupe crée en 2009 à Mexico, composé de neuf musiciens qui se plaisent à créer des compositions originales inspirées de l'univers du cirque, basées sur des styles de musiques traditionnelles de différents pays, parmi lesquels polka, tango, manouche, valse, paso doble, Balkans, Oaxaca, etc. L'une des préoccupations principales du groupe, en plus de la musique, est l'interaction avec les personnes afin de rapprocher la scène et le public car la variété des disciplines (performance, comédie) et le langage visuel (univers du cirque) sont des éléments essentiels du spectacle, en faisant de la rue le principal laboratoire d'improvisation et d'apprentissage.

Eines der wichtigsten Anliegen der Gruppe ist neben der Musik die Interaktion mit den Zuhörern, um die Barriere zwischen Bühne und Publikum aufzuheben. Deshalb sind die Interaktion (Performance, Sketch) und die Bildsprache (Zirkuselemente) ein wesentlicher Teil der Show, wobei die Straße als primärer Ort der Präsentation, Improvisation und des Lernens gilt.

Awalnya sekelompok pemuda terdiri dari Aldonny, Heru, Dicky dan Hendra mencoba turut menyuarakan kepedihan mereka terhadap kehidupan. Dengan nama Mutant X mereka membawakan lagu lagu band kesukaan mereka. Seiring dengan perjalanan waktu mereka merasa nama Mutant X kurang Indonesia. Akhirnya terpilihlah JERUJI sebagai nama yang mewakili mereka pada saat dipanggil ke atas panggung.\n\nPerjalanan karier Jeruji meniti arus naik turun dan pahit manisnya panggung ke panggung. Hingga pada akhirnya mereka diajak terlibat dalam satu kompilasi klasik yang bertajuk Bandung’s Burning pada tahun 1997 yang diproduksi oleh Riotic Recs dengan single No Really Competitions. Masih pada tahun yang sama Jeruji menerima ajakan untuk terlibat dalam satu kompilasi yang di produksi oleh label Tian An Men ..89 Recs dari Perancis dan masuklah single Pianjingeun pada kompilasi yang dirilis dalam bentuk piringan hitam ukuran 7 inci dan beredar di Perancis dan negara Eropa lainnya secara independen.\n\nPada tahun 1998 setelah sekitar 2 tahun mencoba dari panggung ke panggung underground scene di Indonesia akhirnya Jeruji menelurkan album perdananya secara independen dengan judul Freedom yang dirilis oleh 41 Recs Bandung. Pada tahun yang sama juga kompilasi Brain Beverages dirilis dan single Broken adalah lagu Jeruji yang terlibat didalam kompilasi yang dirilis oleh Harder Recs Bandung.\n\nTernyata gaung Jeruji sampai juga ke negara Matahari Terbit dan sebuah records company bernama All System Fail merilis kembali kompilasi yang berisi single Pianjingeun bekerja sama dengan Tian An Men ..89 Recs dalam bentuk compact disc dan dirilis pada tahun 1999. Di dalam negeri sendiri Jeruji ternyata concern dengan tidak adanya skatepark yang representatif untuk para skateboarder bermain. Seiring dengan ide itu Jeruji diajak oleh ISA (Indonesian Skateboarding Association) dan Spills Records untuk membuat kompilasi yang keuntungannya diperuntukan pada pembuatan Skatepark. Single Drunk With Power menjadi salah satu lagu yang ada dalam A Ticket To Ride “benefit for local skatepark” yang dirilis oleh Spills Records.\n\nPada tahun 2000 Jeruji berubah formasi dan memutuskan untuk menambah personel sebagai bagian dari dinamisnya musik Jeruji. Robby mengisi posisi gitar dan memberi nafas baru bagi Jeruji. Dan pada tahun ini juga album Lawan dirilis oleh Napi Recs. Perjalanan panggung Jeruji ternyata tidak berhenti, tetapi malah semakin banyak dan mendewasakan masing masing personelnya.\n\nIde pembuatan live recording yang melibatkan penonton secara langsung memang belum ada waktu itu di Indonesia ternyata menarik untuk beberapa pihak. Dan akhirnya terwujud sudah dan melibatkan beberapa band pionir dan label independen di Bandung. Dengan tajuk 4 Harvest Live Recording Jeruji bersama dengan Puppen, Forgotten dan Blind To See melakukan pertunjukan yang direkam secara live di Dago Tea House indoor pada tahun 2001 yang rencananya akan dirilis dalam bentuk kaset, CD dan VCD.\n\nPada akhir tahun 2003, formasi terakhir Jeruji yaitu Aldonny ”Themfuck”, Heru, Robby, Sanny dan Opick telah merampungkan materi lagu untuk album yang ketiga. Setelah melalui proses negosiasi dan sign kontrak dengan salah satu label rekaman independen, akhirnya pada bulan Agustus 2004 album mereka yang diberi nama 3rd berhasil dirilis secara eksklusif oleh Subciety Records. Album tersebut berisikan 13 lagu dengan materi dan nuansa yang sangat berbeda dari album mereka sebelumnya. Sebagai pemanasan bagi skena bawah tanah di Indonesia, Jeruji baru saja merampungkan video klip untuk Single Lawan. Namun setelah identitas diri mereka mulai tumbuh di dalam sebuah komunitas yang cukup solid di Bandung, akhirnya Jeruji harus ditinggalkan oleh salah satu gitarisnya yaitu Heru dan sementara untuk mengisi kekosongannya posisi tersebut digantikan oleh Ayi sebagai additional. Line-up tersebut tidak bertahan lama karena Ayi mundur kemudian Robby sempat minta ijin cuti untuk menikah, lalu masuk Badik dan Robby kembali main gitar sampai akhirnya Robby mengalami kecelakan yg cukup parah. Ale dari Full of Hate kemudian masuk menggantikan, hingga sekarang.","booking_agent":"+62816623225","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151233770291049","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/23917_10151233770291049_227793742_n.jpg","offset_y":36,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Bandung, Indonesia","description":"1st album Freedom\n2nd album Lawan\n3rd album 3rd\n4th album Warlock in store now!","general_manager":"Meg : http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=761929571","genre":"Hardcore, Metal, Punk","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Bandung, Indonesia","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":282129,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/jeruji.band","name":"Jeruji","press_contact":"+62817205701","record_label":"Rockabilly Syndicate Records, 41 Recs Bandung, Napi Recs, Subciety Records.","release_date":"1996","talking_about_count":3136,"username":"jeruji.band","website":"http://www.myspace.com/jeruji http://www.musikator.com/jeruji http://www.facebook.com/jeruji.band http://m.facebook.com/jeruji.band http://touch.facebook.com/jeruji.band","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Pallett Band","id":"327107644024970","info":{"id":"327107644024970","app_id":"0","band_members":"Dariush Azar\nRouzbeh Esfandarmaz\nKaveh Salehi\nMahyar Tahmasebi\nHesam Mohammadinanpour\nOmid Nemati\n\nspecial appearance:\nKhatereh Hakimi\nMehdi Saki\nFaraz Aghili","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":467669099968823,"source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/s720x720/64241_467669099968823_287265355_n.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Tehran, Iran","general_manager":"Amin Davaie / http://www.facebook.com/amin.davaie","genre":"World-Fusion-Jazz","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Tehran, Iran","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":21999,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pallettmusic","name":"Pallett Band","press_contact":"info@pallettmusic.com","talking_about_count":3134,"username":"pallettmusic","website":"http://www.pallettmusic.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Allegro Band","id":"177527095597742","info":{"id":"177527095597742","about":"Allegro Band - offical page  Menadzer: Bojan Rasevic; +38766766766; rasevic@live.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Gitara - Bozidar Popovic\nBass gitara - Stefan Pavlovic\nBubnjevi - Sasa Sharan Nikolic\nKlavijature i Vokal - Nikola Liknic \nVokal - Sladjana Vujicic","bio":"Allegro Band - offical page \nwww.facebook.com/allegroband \nKontakt: Bojan Rasevic; +38766766766; rasevic@live.com\nAllegro Band je sastavljen od vrsnih muzičara iz Obrenovca.

En sus presentaciones no es raro verlos bajar con sus instrumentos, tocando mientras se acomodan entre el público, ahí todo se convierte en un delirante carnaval, una gran fiesta en medio del cemento. La Banda Conmoción es una tropa, una familia que toca junta hace 10 años, y tal vez por eso es que en lugar de discos, sólo han dejado recuerdos para quienes tuvieron la suerte de estar ahí. Partieron el año 2001 como proyecto musical paralelo a los montajes de Teatro Mendicantes, siguieron su recorrido en matrimonios, bautizos y funerales, antes de llegar a los escenarios (año 2005).\n\nLo suyo es el formato instrumental del tambo nortino, las fiestas de pueblo,la cumbia, el porro, las cuyahuadas, el vals, el bolero, el San juanito, diríamos que esta gran Banda a formado sus cimientos en su amor a la música de nuestra Latinoamérica y hace unos años han incluido repertorio de la música gitana, Así lo han hecho, extendiendo y difundiendo esta música con la energía que los caracteriza, , todo mezclado, como si fueran la banda sonora de una salitrera aún en funcionamiento. La Banda Conmocion en estos años ha compartido escenario con artistas como Manka Saya, Arak Pacha, Mauricio Redoles, Manuel Sanchez, Alfonso Rubio, Los Mentaos, Los trukeros, Escuela Chinchin tirapie, Juana Fe, La Mano Ajena, Chico Trujillo, La Floripondio, Fiskales Ad Hok, Los Miserables, Patogallina Saundmachin, Sonora Palacios, Sinergia, Anita Tijoux, Escaso Aporte, Sonora de Llegar, Sol y Lluvia, Francesca Ancarola, José Seves, Banda Fuerza Maestra, Banda Proyección, La todo mal orquesta, Es Comediant, entre varios.\n \nSon diez años de desplazamiento promoviendo una sonoridad que no necesita del suministro eléctrico y que ha permitido a la Banda Conmoción llegar a diversos parajes, otorgando una experiencia que se plasma en su primer trabajo de estudio bautizado como “Sonido Esencial”. Tinkus, cha-cha-cha, cumbias y ritmos gitanos, escuchados en las bandas instrumentales peruanas, bolivianas y los papayeros de Colombia, además de las fanfarrias gitanas de la región de los Balcanes son las influencias de las que se nutre.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151641132390746","source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/420759_10151641132390746_2046303089_n.jpg","offset_y":-1200,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Chile","influences":"Espectaculares Amautas, Pagador de Oruro, Mike Laure, Pedro Laza, Gaiteros de San Jacinto, James Brown, Tito Puente, Tomy Rey, Jacques Brel, Fanfare Ciocarlia, Kocani Orchestar, Goran Bregovic, Los Charros de Lumaco, The Clash, La Huambaly, Los corraleros de Majagual, Alfredo Gutierres.","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":89562,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/bandaconmocion","name":"Banda Conmoción","talking_about_count":2882,"username":"bandaconmocion","website":"http://www.bandaconmocion.cl/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Setia BAND Setiaku","id":"125335417599842","info":{"id":"125335417599842","about":"SETIA BAND","app_id":"0","band_members":"Muhammad Charly Van Houttens ( Charly ) vokal , Dedy Sudrajat ( Pepeng ) gitar, Jeane Phialsa ( Alsa ) drum","bio":"SETIA BAND didirikan oleh Charly & Pepeng yaitu mantan dari vokalis & gitaris ST12 setelah memutuskan keluar dari ST12 .

This remarkable band has been influenced by a number of factors: on one hand by ambitious students, their respect for the art of music and willingness to develop their musical skills; on the other hand – a huge array of experience, the highest level of professionalism, and an openness by the teachers towards the creative spirit of their students. These, combined with endless hours of practice, were the foundation for the first collaborative concert of teachers and students.\nThe beginnings, however, were not easy. The band, which did not publicly perform at the time, frequently changed members and invited different musicians to cooperate with them. At long last, “Daddy’s Cash” has been established with the following band members:\n\n    Maciej Gruchacz - guitar\n    Radoslaw Dzielski – guitar\n    Krzysztof Czerkawski – guitar\n    Milosz Skwirut – bass\n    Marcin Dyjak – harmonica\n    Wojciech Inglot – electric piano, organ\n    Michał Jasiczek - alto saxophone, tenor saxophone\n    Szymon Bobrowski – trumpet\n    Michal Borowski – trombone\n    Jedrzej Jasiczek – drums\n    Lukasz Wiercioch – percussion instruments\n\nThe band explored a wide variety of music styles – from Blues and Rock to Jazz.

Karla a muy temprana edad manifestó su gusto por la música, la actuación y el canto, siendo este último, la herramienta que utilizaría para entrar al mundo de la televisión. A la edad de 5 años, empezó a hacer sus primeras apariciones en público masivo, en donde interpretaba canciones cristianas en los eventos donde se presentaba. Más tarde tuvo el agrado de pisar grandes escenarios, como el Teatro Caupolicán, Estadio Nacional y el Movistar Arena compartiendo éste con el gran cantante cristiano Marcos Witt.\nA los 12 años, comenzó a presentarse a los casting Infantiles de los programas de televisión, en donde si bien en ese tiempo eran escasos, quedó seleccionada en dos de ellos. (Bravo Bravissimo, Buenos Días a Todos y Con Ustedes). Luego a la edad de 18 años, viajó a Buenos Aires, Argentina para presentarse en el programa Latin American Idol.\nDespués de un descanso, en donde comenzó a estudiar en la Universidad, se presenta la posibilidad de probar suerte en el programa juvenil de Chilevisión: Yingo, temporada que fue denominada “Las estrellas del futuro”. Pasado un mes y medio de dicha competencia, el programa da un giro y se queda con 8 de sus 20 participantes, en donde vuelve a ser un programa de entretención. Karla, fue una de las seleccionadas para seguir en el programa junto a su hermano Kevin, en donde formaron parte del Elenco hasta principios del año 2012. En medio de la competencia “Estrellas del futuro”, Karla es convocada por el director del programa, Alex Hernández, para participar en la serie juvenil de dicho canal, en el horario de las 20 hrs. Fue así como Karla debutó en la actuación, obteniendo el papel protagónico de la teleserie Gordis en dónde le dio vida  a “Amelia” e interpretó  4 de las 5 canciones principales de la banda sonora inédita: “Por tu amor”, “Dulce Caramelo”, “Yo soy asi”   ( versión electro y versión acústica) . \nEn conjunto con su trabajo en Televisión, Karla comenzó junto a Kevin, a trabajar en sus proyectos musicales, desarrollándose como autores, compositores e intérpretes.  Es así como nace “Kevin, Karla y la Banda” , Dúo Chileno, quienes se caracterizan por hacer Covers de Artistas internacionales, traducidos a Español, siendo los Jóvenes Chilenos más escuchados por Internet (Youtube) en Chile y Latinoamérica, con cerca de 5 millones de Visitas.\n","genre":"Electro/Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Santigo, Chile","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":49467,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/KevinKarlayLaBanda","name":"Kevin,Karla y La Banda","record_label":"Feria Mix/Music Chile - Sergio Delgado C.

Dari sekadar bersenda gurau, lalu meningkat pada intensitas pertemuan, kemudian lahirlah sebuah ide untuk membentuk sebuah band dengan nama Seven Rastaman\n\nLazimnya pertumbuhan sebuah band, kami pun mengalami perombakan personil. Seiring tambal sulam personil, maka pada tanggal 29 Desember 2009  kami tentukan sebuah nama baru untuk mewakili kami ber 5 , yaitu Pasir Pantai\n\nPemilihan nama tersebut bagi para kami tidak memiliki arti yang sangat khusus. Penggunaan nama Pasir Pantai bagi kami lebih simpel, gampang disebut dan diingat \n\nkami beranggapan bahwa pasir di pantai melambangkan sebuah hubungan yang saling mengenal satu sama lainnya yang berasal dari semua golongan. Kesemua itu, bagi kami merupakan sebuah nilai yang tak terhingga.\n\nBand yang berdomisili di bagian selatan Kota Jakarta ini beranggotakan Leso (vokal), Kinoy (rhythm), Danni (lead), Yugo (bass), dan Ryan (drum). dan muncul Mega (keyboard) . Serta dibantu oleh beberapa pemain additional, yaitu Juri (Perkusi), Selva (vokal)\n\nKami berharap dapat menjadi band yang berkembang lebih baik, maju, sukses, dan dapat memberikan kesan terdalam bagi semua golongan. Sehingga setiap orang yang menyaksikan performansi Kami dapat terhibur, baik secara live maupun dengan mendengarkan via perangkat audio.\n\nPenilaian masyarakat atas respon karya-karya kami merupakan dorongan semangat para personil untuk terus berkarya. Dorongan tersebut diibaratkan seperti ombak yang selalu menggerakkan butiran pasir di pantai ,\n\nSeiring pertumbuhannya, alhamdulillah kini kami sudah memiliki 5 buah single. berkat doa orang tua dan kalian semua sahabat sahabat yang sudah dukung kami dari awal sampai saat ini, Terimakasih bradsist","booking_agent":"0813 - 14335947 / 0838 - 97963172 (booking), PIN 208F9DF3 (Dendy)","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":533637926671032,"source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s720x720/558417_533637926671032_800868716_n.jpg","offset_y":47,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Jakarta Selatan - Bintaro","description":"Berkat rahmat Tuhan Yang Maha Esa PASIR PANTAI telah menghasilkan karya nya, dan ini adalah beberapa lagu yang menjadi karya PASIR PANTAI\n\n1.

Royer then introduced Gates to his songwriting partner, Griffin, and the trio joined together in 1968 and signed with Elektra Records, choosing the name \"Bread\" in 1969. The group's first single, \"Dismal Day\", was released in June 1969 but did not chart. Their debut album, Bread, was released in September 1969 and peaked at No. 127 on the Billboard 200. Songwriting on the album was split evenly between Gates and the team of Griffin-Royer. Jim Gordon, a session musician, accompanied the band on drums for the album.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":94288,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bread-band/109028839116955","name":"Bread (band)","talking_about_count":2405,"website":"http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1977-01-29/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Nitty Gritty Dirt Band","id":"56648048892","info":{"id":"56648048892","about":"www.nittygritty.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Jeff Hanna\nJimmie Fadden\nJohn McEuen\nBob Carpenter","bio":"The iconic and profoundly influential Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, often cited as a catalyst for an entire movement in Country Rock and American Roots Music, continues to add to their legendary status. \n\nWith multi-platinum and gold records, strings of top ten hits such as \"Fishin' In The Dark\" and \"Mr. Bojangles\", multiple Grammy, IBMA, CMA Awards and nominations, the band's accolades continue to accumulate.\n\nTheir groundbreaking \"Will The Circle Be Unbroken\" album has been inducted into the U.S. Library of Congress as well as the Grammy Hall of Fame.

                                              BANDA SOM & LOUVOR\n                                         \n                                          O Verdadeiro Som do Louvor\n\nA Banda Som e Louvor surgiu há cerca de 25 anos, na igreja Assembléia de Deus em Jacundá- PA , com músicos que hoje são pais de alguns dos músicos atuais, e outros que faziam parte da igreja. Hoje os componentes são, Samuel(Baterista e Produtor Musical), Jedson(Vocalista e Compositor), Deison(Acordeon), isaias passarinho(Teclado), Marigerson(Baixo), Alexandre(Guitarra). Em 2005, iniciou-se a gravação do primeiro CD, com estilo inovador no meio Gospel, o forró, que é criticado por muitos, mas abençoado por Deus. Já ouvimos muito falar de que o diabo é o pai do rock, reggae do forró quem disse? A única coisa de que ele é pai, é da mentira ( Jó 8.44). Por acaso, foi ele quem criou os instrumentos musicais? É bíblico: 'tudo quanto tem fôlego, louve ao Senhor'. Sendo assim, a Banda Som e Louvor não podiam deixar de atender ao chamado de Deus. Por isso, não deu atenção às palavras destrutivas, muito menos se importou com a resistência dos mais ?tradicionais?, que custaram a aceitar o som da turma por puro preconceito. No mês de Maio de 2006 ele começou a se realizar, com o lançamento do primeiro CD, intitulado Sinal Fechado. Com este CD, os músicos perceberam que Deus estava os provando, mas também abençoando e dando vitórias a cada dia. A emoção, unção e sentimentos transmitidos em suas canções são universais e mexem com o coração do santo Israel de Deus espalhado pela face da terra. Até mesmo os não evangélicos e não seguidores da palavra de Deus se emocionam quando escutam os louvores, que saem dos lábios e instrumentos da Banda Som e Louvor. Seja onde forem, igrejas, congressos, casas de espetáculos, festas missionárias, a recepção é sempre a mesma. Suas músicas falam do imenso amor de Deus, do cuidado que ele tem para com seus filhos, e de como precisamos crer nele para alcançarmos a vitória. No ano de 2007, nasceu um novo projeto nos corações dos componentes da Banda Som & Louvor, e com muita oração e intercessão O projeto ?Regravações? começa a tomar ?corpo? com uma seleção detalhada de repertorio, e em 2008, a Banda lança o Cd ?Usei a Fé? Com as 3 musicas mais tocadas em algumas regiões do Brasil, e as 3 musicas mais baixadas da internet no seguimento Gospel. A Banda se prepara para o LANÇAMENTO DO MAIS NOVO CD em 2009 (É HOJE). A Banda pede a oração dos irmãos em Cristo e a direção de Deus, para conduzi-la nessa jornada de levar Sua palavra a todos que precisam ouvir.","genre":"Forró Gospel","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":29024,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/bandasomelouvoroficial","name":"Banda Som e Louvor (Oficial)","press_contact":"Contatos:(85) 9998-4260 / 3253-4055","record_label":"CANZION BRASIL","talking_about_count":1738,"username":"bandasomelouvoroficial","website":"http://bandasomelouvor.com.br/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Panda","id":"107607475935255","info":{"id":"107607475935255","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"Panda es una banda mexicana de pop punk y rock alternativo, originaria de Monterrey, formada en 1996.Su género ha sido diverso pasando por el pop punk en sus dos primeros discos Arroz con leche y La revancha del príncipe charro, haciendo cambios en su tercer disco, Para ti con desprecio, en el cual sigue la evolución de la banda con letras políticas y más dramáticas que las que se vieron en los discos anteriores.

Since 2009, it consists of David Phelps and Wes Hampton (tenors), Michael English (lead), Mark Lowry (baritone), and Bill Gaither (bass). Although the group started out recording contemporary Christian music, it became known for southern gospel after the popularity of the Gaither Homecoming videos.The lineup of the band changes often, with artists leaving to work on solo careers, and new ones coming to replace them. Besides Bill Gaither, singers with the longest tenure in the band include Guy Penrod (1995–2008), Mark Lowry (1988–2001, 2009–present), and Michael English (1985–94, 2009–present).The band has released 27 albums (not including compilations), at least 19 of which have charted. The band has also released 10 DVDs, which feature many other Christian artists as well. The Gaither Vocal Band has been honored with 2 Grammys, and 16 Dove Awards.HistoryBeginningsThe Gaither Vocal Band is named after gospel legend and leader, Bill Gaither. It was the successor-group of the Bill Gaither Trio. By the 1980s, Bill Gaither, along with wife Gloria Gaither, were both very successful songwriters. For example, their song, \"He Touched Me\" was covered by Elvis Presley, after which he even named his album He Touched Me. Presley won a Grammy for the album. Bill Gaither felt that his trio had reached its peak in the mid-1980s, but his desire to make another gospel hit kept the trio going.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":67633,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Gaither-Vocal-Band/109281185758334","name":"Gaither Vocal Band","talking_about_count":1618,"website":"1=http://www.gaither.com/artists/gaither-vocal-band/|2=Gaither Vocal Band","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Ostentando As Bandidas","id":"126630560836560","info":{"id":"126630560836560","about":"Eu + ☊ + FUNK = foda-se o mundo.

Dody lah yang itu melakukan audisi untuk membentuk format band baru yang terdiri atas drummer, gitaris, bassis, dan vokalis. \n\nPada tanggal 27 September 2004 terbentuklah Kotak dengan format Pare (vokal), Prinzes Amanda/Icez (bass), Mario Marsella/Cella(gitar), dan Haposan Haryanto Tobing/Posan (drum), yang kemudian merilis album pertama yang berjudul Kotak.\n\nNamun, pada tahun 2007, Pare dan Icez mengundurkan diri. Posisi vokal pada akhirnya diisi oleh Swasti Sabda Tantri (Tantri), sedangkan pada bass digantikan oleh Chua, yang kemudian merilis album bertajuk Kotak Kedua pada tahun 2009.\n\nFormasi baru tersebut ternyata membawa kesuksesan besar bagi Kotak. Bukan hanya karena ring back tone (RBT) yang terjual lebih dari satu juta semata, performa mereka di atas panggung juga menjadikan mereka band yang banyak dicari dan mendapat tawaran tur ke berbagai daerah di Indonesia.\n\nNamun sayang, perubahan formasi harus terjadi lagi di tubuh band yang satu ini. Kali ini, Posan yang hengkang dari posisinya sebagai drummer. Kendati demikian, tak menyurutkan semangat Kotak untuk merampungkan album terbaru mereka Energi: Tendangan Dari Langit (Agustus 2011).\n\nKARIR\nDengan mengusung musik modern rock yang sedikit bernuansa dark, serta didukung penampilan gothic, membuat Kotak langsung mendapat tempat di hati para penikmat musik Indonesia.\n\nDebut album pertama diluncurkan pada 2005 dengan title KOTAK. Album self title ini berisi 10 lagu, di antaranya Hilang, Terbang (Khayal), Damai Hati, Kau Pilih Dia, serta banyak lagi lagu lainnya. Album ini cukup diterima oleh para Kerabat Kotak (sebutan fans Kotak).\n\nSelang 3 tahun kemudian, band asal Jakarta ini kembali mengeluarkan album KOTAK KEDUA. Album dengan 12 track ini, berada di bawah label Warner Music Indonesia yang menjagokan hits, Beraksi, Masih Cinta dan Tinggalkan Saja.\n\nNama Kotak semakin diperhitungkan di belantika musik Indonesia, Terbukti Tantri dkk berhasil meraih Grup Rock Terbaik dan Album Rock Terbaik dalam ajang AMI 2009. \n\nTak hanya itu, mereka juga mendapat predikat Grup Pendatang Baru Terbaik versi Anugerah Planet Musik 2009, dan meraih Most Favourite Breakthrough Artist 2009 dari MTV Indonesia Awards.\n\nMenjelang akhir 2009, Kotak kembali merilis single teranyarnya. Single dengan judul Pelan-Pelan Saja ini merupakan 'jembatan' menuju album ketiga Kotak yang bertajuk ENERGI, yang dirilis pada November 2010.\n\nDISKOGRAFI\nAlbum:\n• The Dream Band \"Delapan\" (Desember 2004) - album kompilasi\n• Kotak (Juni 2005)\n• Kotak Kedua (Mei 2008)\n• Energi (November 2010)\n→ Energi: Tendangan dari Langit (Agustus 2011)","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150596953801279","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/419424_10150596953801279_1801070151_n.jpg","offset_y":41,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"DKI Jakarta","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":374827,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/KOTAK-BAND/145004441278","name":"KOTAK BAND","record_label":"Warner Music Indonesia","talking_about_count":1477,"website":"http://www.kotakrockband.com/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Torpedo ( OFICIAL )","id":"230218523743535","info":{"id":"230218523743535","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":414110415354344,"source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/946457_414110415354344_1782173689_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":80},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":42311,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/BandaTorpedoOFC","name":"Banda Torpedo ( OFICIAL )","talking_about_count":1437,"username":"BandaTorpedoOFC","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"The Gap Band","id":"105491452818905","info":{"id":"105491452818905","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"The Gap Band was an American R&B and funk band, who rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s. Comprising brothers Charlie, Ronnie and Robert Wilson, the band first formed as the Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band in 1967 in their hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The group shortened its name to The Gap Band in 1973. After 43 years together, they retired in 2010.HistoryEarly yearsAfter having grown up with a Pentecostal minister father, Ronnie Wilson formed the Greenwood, Archer, and Pine Street Band in 1967, with Tuck Andress (later of Tuck and Patti), Roscoe \"Toast\" Smith and Chris Clayton. In 1972, Ronnie's younger brother Charlie joined the band, and their younger brother Robert became the band's bassist in 1973. Eventually the band would be condensed to comprise the trio of Ronnie, Robert and Charlie Wilson.Early on, the group took on a funk sound more reminiscent of the early 70s. This style failed to catch on, and their first two LP's, 1974's Magician's Holiday and 1977's The Gap Band (not to be confused with their 1979 album) failed to chart or produce any charting singles. However, they were introduced to LA producer Lonnie Simmons, who signed them to his record label, Total Experience Records. Simmons had recently gotten a distribution deal with Mercury/PolyGram.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":60636,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Gap-Band/105491452818905","name":"The Gap Band","talking_about_count":1434,"website":"http://www.gapband.com/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Yonder Mountain String Band","id":"14072405524","info":{"id":"14072405524","about":"Bending bluegrass, rock and countless other influences that the band cites, Yonder has pioneered a sound of their own. www.yondermountain.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Adam Aijala, Ben Kaufmann, Jeff Austin, Dave Johnston","bio":"Yonder Mountain String Band has always played music by its own set of rules.  Bending bluegrass, rock and countless other influences that the band cites, Yonder has pioneered a sound of their own.  With their traditional lineup of  instruments, the band may look like a traditional bluegrass band at first glance but they’ve created their own music that transcends any genre.  Dave Johnston points out “What could be more pure than making your own music.”  Yonder’s sound cannot be classified purely as “bluegrass” or “string music” but rather it’s an original sound created from “looking at music from [their] own experiences and doing the best job possible.”  The band continues to play by their own rules on their new record The Show.\n\nThe Colorado-based foursome has crisscrossed the country over the past eleven years playing such varied settings as festivals, rock clubs, Red Rocks Amphitheater in the band’s home state, and recently the Democratic National Convention in Denver at Mile High Stadium opening for Barack Obama.  Their loyal fanbase has been built from this diverse setting of music venues as fans latched on to their genre-defying original sound.\n \nIn between tours the band spent time this last year working on its fifth studio album. Set for a September 1 release on the band’s own label, The Show is the second album with rock producer Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliott Smith, Foo Fighters). While some might scratch their heads as to why a string band would want a rock producer, this decision was a natural choice for the band.  “We don’t have a lot of nostalgia for the past,” says banjo player Dave Johnston. “You shouldn’t try to recreate the 1940s. I like to think of us as informed by the past and all the great performers before us. But we also want to look forward rather than give people something that has already been perfected.”\n \nThe Show has the similar acoustic instrumentation (Adam Aijala on guitar, Johnston on banjo, Jeff Austin on mandolin and Ben Kaufman on bass with all four singing) as many of its classic bluegrass forefathers. Though once again drums are present (as with the self-titled fourth album) with the great Pete Thomas of Elvis Costello’s bands adding a rhythmic backdrop to Yonder’s still-acoustic sound on six of the tracks. The record consists of thirteen songs all written by Yonder.\n  \nThe band has long cited such varied influences as the bluegrass of Del McCoury, Johnson Mountain Boys, Jimmy Martin, Bill Monroe, Osborne Brothers as well as the punk rock of Bad Religion, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys.  Somewhere in between these two tent poles are early 20th Century composers and alternative rock bands like Grandaddy and Postal Service. It’s  all funneled through the band’s unique chemistry, honed since they first met at an informal club performance in 1998. With band members writing individually, in different pairings and as a collective, the album proves that this group is a collection of creative peers and you can hear it in the rich tapestry of music that makes up The Show.\n \nHere Yonder offers such traditional bluegrass sounding fare as “Out Of The Blue” and “Casualty.” The band has explored its country roots in the past and does so again this time on “Steep Grade, Sharp Curves,” a song that describes the roads around its home base in Nederland as well as a particularly dangerous femme fatale.  A little further from the roots is the impressionistic “Isolate” with its simple but ominous bass line and minimal arrangement. There is also a bevy of rockers like “Complicated,” “Fingerprints” and “Belle Parker,” a gem of a song about a hard-hearted woman. The band even finds some excellent middle ground between bluegrass and rock on “Fine Excuses” thanks in part to a scorching guitar solo from Adam Aijala. There is also the extended “Honestly” -- at eight-minutes, the longest song on the album, with a middle section that is an excellent platform for lengthier live excursions that are as improvisatory as any electric band on the live music circuit.\n \nThe band is a regular at bluegrass festivals like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the band's own Northwest String Summit as well as massive multi-stage events like Austin City Limits Festival, Bonnaroo and Rothbury.  Fans are no doubt drawn to Yonder’s anything goes attitude, its humor and passion about music, and the band’s ability to stretch out live.  “We love that people come to see us,” Johnston points out. “Everyone appreciates good music. Some people want to go to a recital and some people want to party.”\n \nBut as its fans know, Yonder Mountain String Band does something a little different, more than just a musical party. The Show is the band’s most varied and versatile album to date, and the summation of the journey that these guys are on together. It’s bluegrass for the masses, acoustic tunes filled with dazzling chops, and it’s fun to boot. The humble Johnston sounds as surprised as anyone by the band’s success, but knows that it all boiled down to chemistry, which has never changed. “Somewhere down there we all kind of recognized that we had something unique,” he explains. “But there is no way I could have imagined the amount of success that the band has had.”\n\n","booking_agent":"Paradigm","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152829236990525","source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/942101_10152829236990525_49925255_n.jpg","offset_y":68,"offset_x":0},"general_manager":"Yonder Mountain Management","genre":"Acoustic, Rock, Bluegrass","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Nederland, CO","influences":"John Hartford, Tim O'Brien, Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, Phish, Sam Bush and so many more...","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":170832,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/yondermountain","name":"Yonder Mountain String Band","press_contact":"Yonder Mountain Management","record_label":"Frog Pad Records","talking_about_count":1432,"username":"yondermountain","website":"www.yondermountain.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda New Hit","id":"235598166526876","info":{"id":"235598166526876","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":450530501700307,"source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/539695_450530501700307_230974057_n.jpg","offset_y":56,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":89209,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Banda-New-Hit/235598166526876","name":"Banda New Hit","talking_about_count":1223,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"ST12 Band","id":"119979624681971","info":{"id":"119979624681971","about":"ST12 Official Fan Pages More info: http://www.trinityproduction.com Follow Us on Twitter : @ST12_Band @TrinityOptimaP","app_id":"0","band_members":"Muhammad Charly van Houten (Charly) - Vocal\nIlham Febry (Pepep) - Drum\nDedy Sudrajat (Pepeng) - Guitar\n","bio":"ST12 dibentuk pada tanggal 20 Januari 2005, diawali  dengan perkenalan Ilham Febry (Pepep), Muhammad  Charly Van Houten (Charly), Dedy Sudrajat ( Pepeng)  dan Iman Rush, di studio rental milik Pepep di  Bandung. Pertemuan yang kerap terjadi membuat mereka  semakin akrab hingga akhirnya mereka sepakat untuk  membentuk sebuah band, yang diberi nama ST12.\n\nNama ST12 diberikan oleh ayah dari Pepep, Helmi Aziz  (alm) yang merupakan kepanjangan dari Stasiun Timur  12, alamat studio rental tempat mereka bertemu.\n\nPerjuangan ST12 untuk mendapatkan label akhirnya  berbuah ketika album perdana mereka Jalan Terbaik,  berhasil di release di bawah label Music Plus pada  tahun 2005. Tiga single menjadi hits di album ini,  'Aku Tak Sanggup Lagi', 'Aku Masih Sayang', dan  'Rasa Yang Tertinggal'. Keinginan untuk menggapai  eksistensi di dunia music membuat mereka rela untuk  menjalani berbagai rangkaian tour show panjang.  Kerja keras ST12 tak sia-sia, penjualan album  perdana mereka mencapai lebih dari 400.000 copies  dan Ring Back Tone nya diunduh hingga lebih dari  1.000.000 download.\n\nNamun ditengah usaha keras mereka untuk mencapai  kesuksesan, Charly, Pepep, dan Pepeng harus menerima  kenyataan pahit kehilangan salah satu personel ST12  - Iman Rush - yang meninggal dunia di Semarang  akibat pecahnya pembuluh darah di otak pada tgl 22  Oktober 2005.\n\nTahun 2008, ST12 merilis album P.U.S.P.A dibawah  label PT. Trinity Optima Production. Di album ini,  Charly menciptakan lagu 'Saat Terakhir' yang  didedikasikan untuk Iman Rush. Lagu 'Puspa' dengan  cepat diterima oleh pecinta musik Indonesia. Lagu  ini berada di puncak tangga lagu di radio-radio  Indonesia selama 5 (lima) minggu dan bertahan di  chart selama 15 (lima belas) minggu. Tak putus hanya  di lagu Puspa, eksistensi ST12 semakin kuat dengan  direleasenya single-single lain dari album Puspa.  Lagu 'Cari Pacar Lagi', 'Saat Terakhir', dan 'Jangan  Pernah Berubah', membawa ST12 masuk ke jajaran artis  teratas di Indonesia.\n\nHanya dalam rentang waktu 3 (tiga) bulan, ST12  berhasil meraih penghargaan double platinum award  atas penjualan album PUSPA. Tak hanya itu, pengakuan  atas karya ST12 juga terlihat dari digunakannya  lagu-lagu ST12 sebagai themesong di berbagai  sinetron yang tayang di televisi.\n\nPadatnya jadwal show, kini menjadi keseharian  mereka.

Where are his mother and father? Why is he not at school? … To get an answer, they go to their teacher, but her answers only make new questions for them …\n… and this is just the beginning of a path toward finding “Peace”. The Whiteeagles fly for “Peace” in the hope of having grown-ups make friends, just like children do.\nPeace Song\nThe word “Peace” is regarded sacred in all cultures and nations. All peace-loving people in the world, who are after happiness for all humans, have in fact tried to create a real peace in the four corners of the world so that all humans can live peacefully together. However, unfortunately, it seems that in earthly life there are forever quarrels and wars among those who forget peace, causing nothing but destruction, homelessness, and poverty. Moreover, the main victims are innocent and defenseless children. Numerous are the instances of children who have lost their homes in wars, many of whom have lost their families and friends. The highest aspiration of the Whiteeagles is for all these destructions and sorrows to come to an end. Therefore, they decided to sing a song to inform the world of all the pain and suffering of war children and to remind grown-ups of their true and sincere childhood friendships. \nWith this goal in mind and under the supervision of their teachers, they wrote the “Peace” song and composed appropriate music for it. Then, the Whiteeagles spent several months practicing and rehearsing the song to really master it. Immediately after the release of “Peace”, there was a widespread support which was quite predictable, because “what comes from the heart reaches the heart”. The high turnout for the Whiteeagles’ live concert at the Sadabad Palace in November 2011 was an eloquent affirmation of the right path chosen by Arshia and Bardia. It was then when they decided to make a video clip for the song so that – with its distribution – the full potential of the song and its message could be reached, enabling people all around the world to hear the cry for peace. The DVD you are holding is the culmination of all the efforts to make it happen. \nWhen their song and the video clip change hands among people, at any age, of every color and race, the Whiteeagles heartily hope that it is a small step toward a great cause: “together we can all witness brighter days”.\nArshia’s biography\nArshia was born in Iran in 1998. Arshia’s personal passion for music and playing musical instruments began since his early years. At the age of four, he started learning music, playing the organ and the flute. Then, he continued learning the piano more seriously, and at the age of 7 he chose the violin to play professionally. In the process of learning classical music, he gradually became interested in modern and alternative music. His piano classes helped Arshia’s singing talent to flourish, which was the beginning of him, following his artistic pursuit of both singing and playing seriously.  \nBardia’s biography\nBardia was born in Iran in 1999. Bardia also began his music lessons together with Arshia. Then, at the age of 6, in addition to learning the piano, he chose the guitar as his professional instrument to play. He also, under the supervision of his teachers, became interested in singing. Bardia has been receiving quality education and training from his expert teachers. \nArshia and Bardia’s interests in other types of art such as painting helped the growth of other artistic senses and creative skills in the Whiteeagles, which later on played an important role in the evolutionary development of their artistic styles. \nThe education of the boys has not been just restricted to music. Arshia and Bardia have been homeschooled to learn all lessons necessary to have a better perception of the world. Love for and understanding nature are among their most important lessons. They have learned about planting to feel the actual meaning of growth and the process of nature turning green. Arshia and Bardia love animals, and they live with them in order to realize that God has created animals, and therefore, like humans, they also have the right to live.\nIn today’s world, known as the communication era, any artist who wishes to get their message across to the world should speak a language which almost everybody can understand. Therefore, since early childhood, Arshia and Bardia started learning English and French, to help not only the audience speaking their same mother tongue, but also other people in the world to hear the song of peace and friendship and to sing with them in unison. It is an undeniable truth that the more audience for the Whiteeagles, the more their enthusiasm and strength, the more far-reaching effects. \nUsing their instructors’ experiences with hard regular exercise, the boys have stretched their abilities so well that they can now very easily cope with challenging and demanding rehearsals necessary for their live concerts and video clips. Horse riding, skating, and swimming are among Arshia and Bardia’s other favorite sports.  \nThere are a lot of musicians all around the world who, in addition to their musical skills, also choose other forms of arts so that they can convey their message to their audience through those other channels as well. Along the same line, Arshia and Bardia also portray the joy of life on the canvas of their paintings. Their distinctive style, which considers even the frame as part of the canvas and therefore their painting continues onto it, comes from their special distinctive outlook on the art of painting. Behind each of their paintings, you can trace a concern, which is the eternal concern of humans: peace. \nThe birth of the Whiteeagles\nIn March 2010, the Whiteeagles had their debut performance with the cover version of the Beatles’ hit “Yesterday”. This song has been covered numerous times in the world; therefore, singing it with a different style is a big challenge. However, with their distinctive style, the Whiteeagles accomplished it.\nEight months later, in November 2010, the Whiteeagles sang “Never Give Up” and made its video. This song won the Whiteeagles a legion of fans, which marked a new phase in their singing career, so they decided to create their own song and music. Despite having the support of their first-class advisers, their own intellectual independence and special artistic creativity have been prioritized. \nThe Whiteeagles’ distinctive performances have gradually been developing since their third and fourth works, i.e. “Joy in Joy” and “My Shadow”, in 2011, the performance of which turned the Whiteeagles into one of the youngest pop-rock bands ever, a really great experience for them. \nThe preparation of “Peace” video clip, the fifth and the newest work of the Whiteeagles, started in 2011. This video clip is a combination of various techniques. The videography of the children and the singers were in the form of green curtain and the other sections were done by linear animation and digital composition. \nThe Whiteeagles’ next project entitled “Set up the Fire” is a joyful video clip taking into account the international taste of the young, which is unique in its own right. \nThis video clip is a combination of the actual urban spaces and virtual robotic 3-D characters, telling the story of modern urban life and people in the machine era. \n    \n\nمقدمه\nوقتی پسرک دست فروش را می‌بینند از خودشان می‌پرسند این پسر در بین جنگل ماشینها و هیاهوی مردم چه می‌کند؟ پدر و مادرش کجا هستند؟ چرا الآن در مدرسه نیست؟... برای گرفتن پاسخ به سراغ معلمشان می‌روند، اما پاسخ او سؤالهای بعدی را در ذهن آنها ایجاد می کند...\n...و این تازه اول راه است. راهی به سمت پیدا کردن صلح. عقابهای سپید برای صلح پرواز می‌کنند، به این امید که بزرگترها هم مثل بچه ها با هم دوست باشند.\nترانه صلح\nواژه صلح واژه‌ای مقدس در بین تمام فرهنگ‌ها و ملیت‌ها به شمار می‌رود. تمام حامیان صلح که در جهان برای سعادت بشر کوشیده‌اند در تلاش بودند که در زمین صلحی واقعی شکل بگیرد و انسانها در کنار یکدیگر بتوانند با آرامش و دوستی زندگی کنند. اما متاسفانه روی این کره خاکی همیشه نزاع و جنگ بین انسانهائی که صلح را فراموش می‌کنند رخ می‌دهد که نتیجه آن هم چیزی جز ویرانی، آوارگی و فقر نیست و قربانیان اصلی این دشمنی‌ها کودکان بی‌گناه و بی‌دفاع هستند. چه بسیار کودکانی که در جنگ‌ها بی‌خانمان شده‌اند و بسیاری از آنها خانواده و دوستانشان را از دست داده‌اند. آرمان واقعی عقابهای سپید پایان یافتن این ویرانی و غم در سرتاسر جهان برای همیشه است. بنابراین تصمیم گرفتند با خواندن ترانه‌ای دنیا را از درد و رنج کودکان جنگ آگاه کنند و آدم بزرگ‌ها را به یاد دوستی‌های پاک و بی آلایش دوران کودکیشان بیندازند.\nبا این هدف و با راهنمائی اساتیدشان شعر \"صلح\" سروده و ملودی مناسب آن نیز ساخته شد. سپس عقابهای سپید چند ماه را صرف تمرین و اجرای آهنگ کردند تا به پختگی کامل رسیدند. بلافاصله پس از انتشار ترانه \"صلح\"، استقبال فو‌ق‌العاده‌ای از آن شد که قابل پیش‌بینی بود چرا که هرچه از دل برآید لاجرم بر دل نشیند و استقبال شنوندگان از اجرای زنده عقابهای سپید در نوامبر 2011 در کاخ سعدآباد مهر تائیدی بود بر درستی راهی که ارشیا و بردیا انتخاب کرده بودند. پس از آن بود که تصمیم گرفتند ویدئو کلیپی برای این ترانه بسازند تا با پخش آن پتانسیل واقعی ترانه و پیامش به فعل درآید و همه مردم جهان صدای صلح را بشنوند. این \"دی‌وی‌دی\" که اکنون در دستان شماست نتیجه تلاشها برای به ثمر نشاندن آن تصمیم است.\nآرزوی قلبی عقابهای سپید این است که با پخش این ترانه و کلیپ در سرتاسر جهان و دست به دست شدنش در بین همه، چه کودک و چه بزرگسال و از هر رنگ و نژاد، قدمی کوچک برای رسیدن به هدفی بزرگ برداشته باشند تا \"در کنار یکدیگر روزهای روشن‌تری را ببینیم\"\nبیوگرافی ارشیا\nارشیا در سال 1998 در ایران به دنیا آمد. علاقه شخصی ارشیا به موسیقی و نوازندگی در همان دوران طفولیت شکل گرفت. در سن 4 سالگی آموزش‌های موسیقیائی خودش را با نوازندگی ساز ارگ و فلوت آغاز کرد. بعد از آن ساز پیانو را به شکل جدی‌تری ادامه داد و در 7 سالگی ویلن را به عنوان ساز تخصصی خود انتخاب نمود و همزمان با گذراندن دوره های آموزش موسیقی کلاسیک، به‌تدریج  به موسیقی مدرن و آلترناتیو علاقه‌مند شد. آموزش در کلاس‌های پیانو باعث شکوفائی استعداد ارشیا در زمینه خوانندگی شد و این آغازی بود برای ادامه جدی و علمی نوازندگی و خوانندگی در کنار هم. \nبیوگرافی بردیا\nبردیا در سال 1999 در ایران به دنیا آمد. بردیا نیز دوره¬های آموزش موسیقی و نوازندگی خود را در کنار برادرش ارشیا آغاز کرد. بعد از آن در سن 6 سالگی همزمان با نوازندگی پیانو، گیتار را به عنوان ساز تخصصی خود انتخاب کرد و او نیز تحت تعلیم اساتیدش به خوانندگی علاقمند شد. بردیا همچون برادرش تعلیم و آموزش را همچنان تحت نظر اساتید مجرب ادامه می‌دهد.\nعلاقه ارشیا و بردیا به هنرهای دیگری مثل نقاشی باعث شکل گیری روحیات هنری و خلاقانه دیگری در عقابهای سپید شد که بعدها نقش مهمی در تکامل نگرش هنری آنها ایفا کرد. \nدرآموزش پسرها فقط به موسیقی بسنده نشد. ارشیا و بردیا تمام آن چیزهائی که برای درک جهان باید بیاموزند را به صورت تدریس خانگی (Home School) فرا می‌گیرند. دوستی و آشنائی با طبیعت از مهمترین این درسهاست. گیاه‌کاری را یاد گرفتند تا مفهوم رویش و سبز شدن را لمس کنند و عاشق حیوانات هستند و با آنها زندگی می‌کنند تا درک کنند که آنها هم مانند انسانها مخلوق خداوند هستند و حق حیات دارند.\nدر دنیای امروز که عصر ارتباطات لقب گرفته هر هنرمندی برای رساندن پیامش به جهانیان باید به زبانی سخن بگوید که همگانی باشد. از اینرو از همان کودکی ارشیا و بردیا تحت تعلیم مربیان، زبانهای انگلیسی و فرانسه را آموخته‌اند تا در کنار مخاطب همزبانشان، سایر مردم جهان آواز دوستی و صلحشان را بشنوند و با آنها هم‌آواز شوند. این یک واقعیت مسلم است که هر چقدر مخاطبان عقاب‌های سفید بیشتر باشند آنها با قدرت و دلگرمی بیشتری به راهشان ادامه خواهند داد و تاثیرگذارتر خواهند بود.\nپسرها با بهره گیری از تجربیات مربیان خود و با ممارست و تلاش زیاد هم‌اکنون به راحتی از پس تمرین‌های سخت و طاقت‌فرسائی که برای اجراهای زنده و کلیپ‌های ویدئویی باید داشته باشند برمی‌آیند. سوارکاری، اسکیت و شنا دیگر ورزشهای محبوب ارشیا و بردیا هستند.\nموسیقیدان‌های زیادی در سرتاسر جهان علاوه بر موسیقی، هنرهای دیگری را هم برمی‌گزینند تا بتوانند در کنار موسیقی از طریق این هنرها هم حرفهایشان را به گوش مخاطبان برسانند. در این راستا ارشیا و بردیا هم شور زندگی را بر روی بوم نقاشی به تصویر می‌کشند. سبک متفاوت آنها که حتی قاب نقاشی را هم جزئی از بوم می‌بینند و خلق تصویر را تا آن ادامه می‌دهند نشأت گرفته از نگاه ویژه و خاصشان به هنر نقاشی است. در پس تمام نقاشی‌هایشان هم می‌توان رد یک دغدغه را گرفت، همان دغدغه ازلی و ابدی انسان، صلح.\nتولد گروه \"عقاب‌های سپید\"\nدر مارس 2010 عقابهای سپید اولین آهنگشان را خواندند؛ ترانه معروف \"Yesterday\" از گروه بیتلز. این ترانه بارها و بارها توسط خوانندگانی در سرتاسر جهان خوانده شده و بازخوانی آن با سبکی متفاوت چالشی بزرگ محسوب می‌شد، اما عقابهای سپید با اجرائی متفاوت از عهده آن برآمدند.\nبه فاصله هشت ماه و در نوامبر 2010 عقابهای سپید ترانه و ویدئو کلیپ \"Never Give Up\" را ضبط کردند. با شنیده شدن این ترانه خیلی زود طرفداران بسیاری برای خود دست و پا کردند، حالا دیگر کارشان وارد فاز جدیدی شده بود. بنابراین تصمیم گرفتند که موسیقی خودشان را خلق کنند. اگر چه در این راه مشاوران طراز اولی همراهشان بودند و هستند اما استقلال فکری و خلاقیت‌های هنری خاص خودشان در اولویت است.\nاجراهای خاص عقابهای سپید به تدریج و از سومین و چهارمین کارشان          \"Joy In Joy\" و \"My Shadow\" در سال 2011 شکل گرفت. ترانه هایی که با آن عقابهای سپید تبدیل به کم سن و سال ترین گروه راک ـ پاپ شد که تجربه‌ای بسیار بزرگ برای آنها محسوب می‌شد.\nساخت ویدئو کلیپ صلح، پنجمین و جدیدترین کار گروه عقابهای سپید در سال 2011 آغاز شد. این ویدئو کلیپ تلفیقی از تکنیک های مختلف می‌باشد. بخش‌های تصویربرداری از کودکان و خوانندگان بصورت پرده سبز و بقیه بخش‌ها بصورت انیمیشن خطی و کامپوزیت (تلفیق) کامپیوتری انجام شد. پروژه ساخت این ویدئو کلیپ سنگین و پیچیده در مارچ 2012 به اتمام رسید. \nپروژه آینده‌ی گروه عقابهای سپید ویدئو کلیپی است شاد به نام \"Set Up The Fire\" که با در نظر گرفتن سلایق بین‌المللی جوانان در نوع خود بی‌نظیر است.\nاین ویدئو کلیپ تلفیقی از فضاهای واقعی شهری و کاراکترهای کامپیوتری رباتیک سه بعدی می‌باشد که روایتی است از زندگی شهری مدرن و انسانهای عصر ماشین.\n","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":398045510286666,"source":"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/399979_398045510286666_421432523_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Pop

Essas são palavras que definem a alma da Eletricaz. Liderado por três cantoras, com igual importância e protagonismo, a banda inova e promete surpreender o público com o melhor do Axé Music.\n\nNa sua primeira formação, a Banda Eletricaz começou sua historia chamando atenção do público e da crítica. Com a sua estreia no Carnaval de Salvador, no ano de 2010, conquistou de imediato o Troféu de Melhor Banda de Trio Independente. A partir daí, o grupo seguiu para uma serie de shows pelo Nordeste e aproveitou o bom momento para gravar seu primeiro CD. \n\nEm 2012, após um período de realinhamento conceitual e musical, a banda segue sua constante evolução, chegando a uma nova e consistente formação. Anny Rosa, Fernanda Millen e Yara Vellasco dão corpo e voz à nova Eletricaz. As cantoras, além de lindas, tem suas historias intimamente ligadas à música da Bahia, acompanharam o surgimento e crescimento do Axé Music e hoje, propõem-se a ser um novo nome deste gênero musical. \n\nAntes de iniciar a maratona de shows pelo Brasil, a Eletricaz passou por uma longa temporada de ensaios. Os shows com a nova formação já começaram em algumas capitais do Nordeste, e já está sendo preparada uma estreia especial para o público baiano. \n\nO show é o carro chefe da banda, pois é nele que o público pode vivenciar o melhor que a Eletricaz oferece: três cantoras muito bem entrosadas no palco, com apresentações performáticas que chamam atenção e divertem o público, além de uma super banda que garante toda a contagiante musicalidade produzida na Bahia. O show da Eletricaz é diversão do começo ao fim!

Preparing the material for their records the band rehearsed and performed a lot. Their first full-length release \"On The Broken Wings\" was presented in March 2006. Later the band made the first video for their track \"The Poles\". The Korea's second album \"The Pulse\" was released in October 2007. The band had several big tours supporting the album in Russia and CIS countries.\nAfter a long creative break the band recorded a single called \"The Sandman\" which was released online on April 9th, 2010. In a while the band made their decision to change the name, sound and stylistic concept. That led to the change of the lead vocals.\nIn summer 2011 The Korea got into the studio to record their third long-play \"The Chariots Of The Gods\". On November 19th the band presented their new single and music video \"The Chaos Theory\".\nThe album \"The Chariots Of The Gods\" was released on January 15, 2012 on the American label Rogue Records. In the winter of that year, guitarists Eugene Potekhin and Alexander Kuznetsov became endorsers of Lepsky Guitars.\nOn March 25, 2013 the group planned a new release named Saturnus. New EP consists of 3 tracks in Russian and in English both. On April 1, The Korea goes to Revenge Of The Universe Tour 2013. After the tour, the video shoot is scheduled.","booking_agent":"thekoreaband@mail.ru","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":470069639732150,"source":"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/s720x720/10050_470069639732150_1485327229_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Russia, Saint - Petersburg","description":"Follow us on Twitter @wearethekorea","general_manager":"thekoreaband@mail.ru","genre":"Experimental Groove Progressive Metal","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Saint - Petersburg","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":33020,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/TheKoreaBand","name":"The Korea band","press_contact":"david@RogueRecordsAmerica.com","talking_about_count":741,"username":"TheKoreaBand","website":"www.thekoreaband.ru","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"NOAH BAND","id":"315777885185557","info":{"id":"315777885185557","about":" Band Member: Ariel, Uki, Lukman, Reza, David.

Enrico Erriquez Greppi, un bilingue dal passato franco-lussemburghese, convince A. M. Finaz, rampante chitarrista elettrico, a gettare alle ortiche qualsiasi amplificatore o pedale di sua appartenenza. Questo per la convinzione di Erriquez che sarebbe bello e divertente portare su un palco la stessa atmosfera di festa che si instaura nelle “cantate tra amici\", momenti magici in cui stonati e intonati uniscono le voci in canti senza fine. Altro classico delle suonate tra amici è che spunta sempre un ‘bonghettaro’! Ecco dunque Paolino alle multi-percussioni, soprattutto djembe e bonghetti, veri simboli del mondo fricchettone. Seguono a ruota la terza chitarra acustica (Orla), il contrabbasso stradaiolo e francofono (Don Bachi), una batteria minimale (il giovane Nuto) ad assicurare le danze, e un fonico di fiducia (Cantax)…\n\n8 Marzo 1993: Quel giorno, oltre a nascere, la bandabardò si chiude in sala prove, dove resta per sei mesi! Con l’aiuto di personaggi vari (Olivier Bellerie - fonico F.F.F.; Antonio Aiazzi - Litfiba - solo per citarne alcuni) e complici le influenze di tutto ciò che di bello è stato scritto e suonato in Italia e Francia, i bardò arrangiano i pezzi trovando presto la chiave giusta per rovesciare dai palchi di tutta Italia e di Parigi (2 mini tour in locali e per strada) un’energia e un’allegria estremamente contagiose. I bardò smetteranno di suonare solo per brevi periodi legati a registrazioni (1994: mini-CD promo; 1996: Il Circo Mangione) o a schianti in furgone (Estate 1996).\nLa storia “recente”\n\nDal primo CD, “Il Circo Mangione” la Bandabardò ha fatto molta strada e molti, molti concerti, ma è sempre rimasta fedele allo spirito del primo album. Dopo il successo ottenuto (\"Il Circo Mangione” vince anche il Premio Ciampi) nel 1998 esce un altro album che conferma il talento del gruppo: “Iniziali B.B.\". Nel 1999 i ragazzi registrano il primo live, “Barbaro Tour\", che esce in copie limitate. Il terzo cd, “Mojito Football Club” esce all’inizio del 2000 e riscuote il favore della critica, venendo eletto come disco del mese da Rockerilla. L’anno successivo la Bandabardò torna con “Se mi rilasso… collasso\", una raccolta di brani live più un brano inedito, “Manifesto” e nel 2002 con “Bondo! Bondo!” il gruppo si propone ancora una volta in tutta la sua ecletticità e versatilità, presentando un lavoro di grande qualità che raggiunge i vertici delle classifiche italiane per alcune settimane.\n\nL’uscita di “Bondo! Bondo!” segna una tappa importante nella storia del gruppo che porta la propria musica in tour in Italia, Spagna, Francia e Svizzera per un anno e mezzo di concerti affollatissimi, facendosi conoscere sempre più anche all’estero. Il 2002 segna inoltre l’uscita di Paolino dal gruppo, sostituito nella tournée invernale da Ughito, percussionista dei Malfunk e vecchia conoscenza dei bardozziani, e poi da aprile 2003 da Ramon ai fiati e alle percussioni.\n\nRamon è da allora parte integrante del gruppo, e ha contribuito in modo significativo anche all’ultimo album.\n\n“Tre passi avanti\", uscito il 3 settembre 2004, è la nuova avventura della Bandabardò che si prepara a un nuovo lunghissimo tour con molte tappe in Italia e all’estero.\nManifesto Politico\n\nLa bandabardò ha sposato in pieno la causa dei fricchettoni e del loro leader Fernandez. Siamo per la rivalutazione dei rapporti umani, dei miscugli razziali e culturali. Lottiamo per un mondo a misura di donna e di bambino e per vedere un giorno trionfare allegria e gentilezza.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151282787917937","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/s720x720/198103_10151282787917937_1330533998_n.jpg","offset_y":74,"offset_x":0},"genre":"Folk/Rock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Firenze","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":100365,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bandabard%C3%B2/37445477936","name":"Bandabardò","record_label":"On the Road / Universal","talking_about_count":722,"website":"http://www.bandabardo.it/ http://it.youtube.com/user/labandatube http://www.myspace.com/bandabardo http://www.bbfc.it/ ","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Marreta you Planeta","id":"274780375881691","info":{"id":"274780375881691","about":"NOVO CD PARA DOWNLOAD - LINK http://www.suamusica.com.br/?cd=104945 - SHOWS DIRETO - 071 9191 8866 - 081 9999 5640 - www.marretayouplaneta.com.br","app_id":"0","band_members":"BANDA MARRETA YOU PLANETA \nVoz: Márcio Dhuka\nTeclados: Thiago\nGuitarra: JR\nBaixo: Zu Bass\nBateria: Felipe Urso\nPercussão: Gildo Madeira, Tiago Thomaz, Pikapau e Gildácio","booking_agent":"Flavio Rogério (71) 9191-8866 / Ronne Araujo (81) 9999-5640","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":621319964561062,"source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/63924_621319964561062_1109532094_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Paulo Afonso","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Paulo Afonso / Salvador BA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":28197,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Banda-Marreta-you-Planeta/274780375881691","name":"Banda Marreta you Planeta","press_contact":"falecom@marretayouplaneta.com.br","record_label":"Independente","release_date":"2008","talking_about_count":721,"website":"www.marretayouplaneta.com.br","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Julion Alvarez Y Su Norteño Banda","id":"444176615675163","info":{"id":"444176615675163","about":"© Pagina Original & Auténtica® █║▌│ █│║▌ ║││█║▌ │║║█ Pagina Creada Con El Fin De Darle El Gusto Con Buena Musica De Julion Alvarez Y Su Norteño Banda ","app_id":"0","bio":"Julio Cesar Álvarez Montelongo mejor conocido como JULIÓN ÁLVAREZ es un joven nacido el 11 de Abril de 1983 en un pueblito llamado Benito Juárez Municipio de la Concordia en el estado de Chiapas, el  segundo de cuatro hermanos.

Although they recorded in a raw manner similar to their contemporaries, minimalizing the use of studio techniques, sound effects and atypical instruments, Television's music was unique and technically proficient, defined by guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd.HistoryTelevision's roots can be traced to the teenage friendship between Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. The duo met at Sanford School in Hockessin, Delaware, from which they ran away. Both moved to New York, separately, in the early 1970s, aspiring to be poets.Their first group together was the Neon Boys, consisting of Verlaine on guitar and vocals, Hell on bass and vocals, and Billy Ficca on drums. The group lasted from late 1972 to late 1973. A 7-inch record featuring \"That's All I Know (Right Now)\" and \"Love Comes in Spurts\" was released in 1980.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":57554,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Television-band/109359182415235","name":"Television (band)","talking_about_count":684,"website":"http://mtv.uol.com.br/programas/bigaudio/videos/big-audio-83-especial-dia-mundial-do-rock-com-television","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"LYLA","id":"79017398266","info":{"id":"79017398266","about":"LYLA is a poprock band from Indonesia.","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"The Beatles, Oasis, Coldplay","band_members":"Indra Perdana Sinaga \nFare Adinata\nDennis Rizky\nDharma\nAmec Jen Aris","bio":"LYLA adalah  grup band yang digawangi Indra Perdana Sinaga ; Vocal, Fare Adinata ; Guitars, Dharma ; Keyboard, Dennis Rizky ; Bass, dan Amec Jen Aris ; Drum mempunyai beberapa hits single dari 2 album dan akan segera merilis album ke 3 ,seperti Takkan ada,Mantan kekasih, Percayakan, Bernafas tanpamu,  Jantung hati, Detik terakhir, MAGIC, Dan lagi, Lebih dari bintang, Akhir cerita, dan yang terbaru Dengan Hati.\n\nKonsep Musik Lyla sendiri adalah poprock  , sound vintage tapi tetap masa kini, berbicara cinta dari berbagai sudut pandang. \n\n","booking_agent":"@robertopieter +62818951886 - For Lyla-ku (fansclub) @boiypr +628996931872/+6285717480381","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151443598543267","source":"http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/425141_10151443598543267_379749832_n.jpg","offset_y":18,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Jakarta, Indonesia","general_manager":"Alfa Records","genre":"poprock","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Jakarta, Indonesia","influences":"U2, Coldplay, Radiohead, Oasis, The Beatles, The Strokes, The Fray, The Verve, Mew, The Cure, 5 For Fighting, Goo Goo Dolls","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":441365,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/LYLAtheBand","name":"LYLA","record_label":"Alfa Records","release_date":"APRIL 2008","talking_about_count":681,"username":"LYLAtheBand","website":"http://www.alfarecords.com/ http://twitter.com/lylaindonesia www.zonalyla.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Jal The Band","id":"252949856420","info":{"id":"252949856420","about":"Jal (Urdu: جل, literal English translation: \"water\") is a pop/rock band formed in Lahore in 2002.

The band originally went by the name Bauhaus 1919, dropping the latter portion within a year of their formation. With their dark, gloomy sound and image, Bauhaus are considered one of the first gothic rock groups.\n\nBauhaus first broke up in 1983. Peter Murphy began a solo career while the other members continued as Tones on Tail and, later, Love and Rockets. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. The band reunited for a 1998 tour and on a more permanent basis in 2005. The group announced plans to disband again after the release of their final album, Go Away White (2008).\n\n(Source: Wwikipedia.org)","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":102715,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bauhaus-the-band/18466360742","name":"Bauhaus, the band","talking_about_count":461,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Pereza","id":"112538875428975","info":{"id":"112538875428975","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"description":"Pereza es un grupo musical de poprock español originario de Alameda de Osuna, Aproximaciones publicado en el verano de 2007, Aviones, publicado en agosto de 2009, y un último álbum recopilatorio en el que se incluyen además dos discos inéditos: Mama quiero ser una estrella del rock'n'roll, y Baires, grabado y editado en Argentina.

Some early members were original to the DC Skinheads (the first Skinhead scene in North America) and had close ties to the Washington, DC hardcore punk subculture, due to its relationship with other hardcore bands, with Ian Mackaye, and with Dischord Records. Singer Sab Grey was one of the many roommates in the Dischord House in Arlington, VA. The band's name — and with most of its members being Skinheads — led to accusations of fascism, which Grey and others in the band and the original DC Skins have always denied. Grey stated in the 1st Iron Cross press kit in 1982, \"...oh, and we're not Nazis!\"CareerIron Cross formed in Washington, DC when Dante Ferrando met Sab Grey. Ferrando was previously in the band Broken Cross with Mark Haggerty while in school. When Grey and Ferrando decided to start a new band, Grey suggested the name Iron Cross. The first lineup consisted of Grey on lead vocals, Haggerty on guitar, Ferrando on drums and John Falls on bass guitar. This lineup lasted a very short time with Falls leaving after Iron Cross' early show at the American University. After Falls' departure the band went through two more bassists before settling on Wendell Blow, the former bassist for the DC hardcore punk band State of Alert, or as it is known SOA. The only non-skinhead in the band was Ferrando, who has usually maintained a spiky hairstyle.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":20144,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Iron-Cross-band/108104062551438","name":"Iron Cross (band)","talking_about_count":420,"website":"http://www.punkoiuk.co.uk/interviews/iron_cross.htm","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"The Mads Banda","id":"130721717104460","info":{"id":"130721717104460","about":"Página oficial da banda maranhense de Pop Rock TheMads\n\nMais informações:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/themads-banda\nhttps://twitter.com/themadsband\nhttp://palcomp3.com/themads/\n\nContato: (98)81243816 - Marco Moraes\nbandamads@hotmail.com","app_id":"0","band_members":"Gustavo Bruno - Vocais\nMarco Moraes - Guitarra\nRonnie Horebe - Baixo\nRamon Ferreira - Bateria","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":159897047520260,"source":"http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/601943_159897047520260_976952014_n.jpg","offset_y":33,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"São Luis","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"São Luis-MA","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":6143,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/themads.banda","name":"The Mads Banda","record_label":"Independente","talking_about_count":405,"username":"themads.banda","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Bucanera","id":"124872531027874","info":{"id":"124872531027874","about":"La mera mera Banda Bucanera de Salvador Yañez","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":151763098338817,"source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/944631_151763098338817_373225466_n.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":8684,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/bandabucanera","name":"Banda Bucanera","talking_about_count":401,"username":"bandabucanera","website":"http://bandabucanera.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"นู่นนี่นั่น Band","id":"423668544371059","info":{"id":"423668544371059","about":"ยินดีต้อนรับเข้าสู่ นู่นนี่นั่น Fanpage จ้า","app_id":"0","band_members":"ฟิวส์ ธนรัช จรรยาสฤทธิ์    <ร้องนำ>\nชิน   ชินณรงค์ จันทร์กำจร <กีต้าร์>\nบอล ชลกฤษ วิถีวานิช      <กลอง,คีย์บอร์ด>\nกาย  ศิวกร เลิสชูโชติ       <เบส>\n\n ","bio":"เป็นวงดนตรีสนุกๆ ก่อตั้งกันที่ม.กรุงเทพจ้า\n\nรางวัลที่ผ่านมา\nรางวัลชนะเลิศ BU Band and Singing Contest20\nรางวัลมือกีตาร์ยอดเยี่ยม BU Band and Singing Contest20\nรางวัลมือกีตาร์ยอดเยี่ยม BU Band and Singing Contest19\nมือเบสยอดเยี่ยม BU Band and Singing Contest20\nมือกลองยอดเยี่ยม BU Band and Singing Contest20\nรางวัลเพลงแต่งยอดเยี่ยม BU Band and Singing Contest20","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":423678224370091,"source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/305917_423678224370091_1220437343_n.jpg","offset_y":15,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":11815,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/NoonNeeNan","name":"นู่นนี่นั่น Band","talking_about_count":378,"username":"NoonNeeNan","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Johnny Jack Mesclado","id":"157428417748741","info":{"id":"157428417748741","about":"Bem vindo a página Oficial da Banda Johnny Jack Mesclado!\nÉ NOIX","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"Bob Marley, Groundation, Cileno, Natiruts, Mato Seco, Israel Vibration, Planta e Raiz, Matisyahu, O rappa, Linha Rasta e muitos outros amigos.","band_interests":"Levar o reggae natural da Amazônia para o mundo!

Kini, band asal Jogjakarta ini merevolusi dirinya sendiri, dengan tampilan yang lebih matang dan dewasa.\n\nSebenarnya, band yang lahir 17 Januari 1999 ini tak tergolong band baru. Di ranah musik pop, Seventeen sudah melahirkan 2 album yang terhitung lumayan. Tidak meledak banget, tapi membuat penikmat musik Indonesia sempat menoleh.\n\nKala itu, selain Bani (bass), Andi (drum), Yudhi (gitar), dan Herman (gitar), divisi vokal masih diisi line-up Doni. Bareng Doni, Seventeen sempat menelorkan dua album [Bintang Terpilih & Sweet Seventeen].\n\nBertapa 3 tahun, ternyata membawa banyak perubahan internal band yang beberapa lagunya sempat menjadi theme-song beberapa sinetron di televisi swasta. Perubahan itu terasa sekali pada\npersonil yang kini mengisi Seventeen. Doni, frontman yang seolah menjadi ikon, memilih mundur. Kemudian tidak ada lagi nama Andi di posisi drum.\n\nMundurnya Doni, memang menjadi “keribetan” sendiri. Selain banyak mencipta lagu di album sebelumnya, karakter vokal Doni sudah ngeblend banget dengan Seventeen. Alhasil, ketika melakukan audisi, personil lainnya sempat ketar-ketir sebelum akhirnya menemukan Ifan, cowok asal Pontianak, sebagai vokalis.\n\nIfan pula yang didapuk sebagai vokalis di album ketiga bertajuk ‘LELAKI HEBAT’ [2008]. Ada perbedaan karakter yang kental. Doni berkarakter rock dengan aksentuasi serak yang khas, sementara Ifan lebih ngepop banget dengan ornamen melayu. Jadilah album ketiga ini, pop habis.\n\nAlbum ini, SEVENTEEN menjagokan single ‘Selalu Mengalah’ yang terdengar lebih fresh dan ngepop dibanding track album sebelumnya. Oh ya, ketika merilis album, band Jogjakarta ini memilih “sarangnya” pembajak di Glodok. Bukan cari sensasi, tapi karena mereka gemas dan sebel dengan ulah pembajak itu. SEVENTEEN sangat sadar, kalau usai rilis album, tiba-tiba saja albumnya sudah ada di lapak-lapak di Glodok. “Itu sudah kita antipasi, meski susah mencegahnya paling tidak kita sudah melakukan aksi,” kata Yudhi, usai acara.\n\nSEVENTEEN memang sedang “bertaruh” dengan keberuntungan. Menjadi band medioker tentu bukan harapan mereka. Tapi kalau memang kudu berkutat dilevelan itu, SEVENTEEN mengaku akan tetap berkarya\n\n\ntentang Ifan : orangnya gaul . lucu g ngebosenin . suka sama lagu yang wannabe to rock gitu dah . walaupun di seventeen gw bawa in lagu yang bernuansa pop .. hhe\n\ntentang Bani : bani adalah pembela ke adilan dalam memecahkan masalah yang tepat .. kya superman ke 3 .\n\ntentang Yudi : im just human, and i'll help anyone who need my help, try to stop war and make's the world peace\n\ntentang Herman : seseorang yang tidak ingin dikatakan sebagai pemalas..\nkarena sifat yang tidak bisa diamnya membuat kegiatan yang dianggapnya dapat bermanfaat..sifat gemar bergaul membuatku banyak teman..prinsip dalam hidup \" JUJUR dan JAGA KEPERCAYAAN.\n\ntentang Andi : orang nya lucu dan satu g pernah bikin masalah .. pokokna sip2 dah anag2 seventeeen","booking_agent":"0812-1614-1717 / 0815-68-625-68 (Resa)","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151234428413391","source":"http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/524734_10151234428413391_1725359798_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Jakarta, Jogjakarta","description":"KOORDINATOR WILAYAH\n\nJOGJA | Danang: 085624847766\n\nSEMARANG | Desy: 085714444317\n\nSURABAYA | Pipid: 085648987890\n\nBANDUNG | Melva : 08986161717\n\nBOGOR | Aya: 085782429669\n\nPADANG | Vivi : 08197563517\n\nPEKANBARU | Via: 085668961017\n\nCIREBON | Moe : 085749784517\n\nTASIKMALAYA | Syifa : 085224428617\n\nPALEMBANG | Randy : 085267076014\n\nBALI | Yuli: 085737367174\n\nSERANG BANTEN | Agis: 08561014017\n\nMAKASSAR | Dodie: 08569566317\n\nSOLO | Kiki: 085647374746\n\nBANJARMASIN | Resti: 085750837067\n\nSAMARINDA | Wahdah: 081350179400\n\nPONTIANAK | Fanny: 085252128208\n\nTERNATE | Ira: 085256230916\n\nBANDA ACEH | Askar : 085277540498\n\nPADANG  | Vivi : 08197563517\n\nPEKAN BARU | Via : 085668961017\n\nINDRAMAYU | Adi : 087828953173\n\nLAMPUNG | Hesty : 087899594939\n\nJAMBI | Tara : 085310112112\n\nTASIKMALAYA | Syifa : 085224428617\n\nTEGAL | Koko : 085642588555\n\nSIGLI ACEH | Nanda : 087890210895\n\nLHOKSUMAWE | Nisa : 08566239399\n\n","genre":"Pop","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Yogyakarta","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":314175,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/SeventeenBand","name":"Seventeen","release_date":"17 Januari 1999","talking_about_count":374,"username":"SeventeenBand","website":"http://mahakaryainc.com/seventeen http://seventeenband.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Desperation Band","id":"6195589726","info":{"id":"6195589726","about":"\"Center of It All\" Buy it HERE! http://tiny.cc/centerofitall","app_id":"0","bio":"Led by Jon Egan, the Desperation Band was birthed out of the student ministries of New Life Church in Colorado Springs. They are recording artist with a great family of worshippers from Integrity Music. Pastored by Brady Boyd, New Life Church and the Desperation Conferences are the core of who they are.\n\nThe Desperation Band has recorded multiple albums with Integrity music, including “Who You Are”, “Everyone Overcome”, and “Light Up The World”. In addition to Desperation Band albums, they have also been featured on three New Life Church recordings… 2006′s “My Savior Lives”, 2008’s “Counting on God”, and the most recent church album “You Hold It All.”\nReleased in the Fall of 2011 came an independent release from Dband called UPDATE:LIVE. This album, raw and barely edited, is a worship experience taken from the Desperation Conferences. On the back of 16 of Dband’s favorite songs from the past few years, this is the sound of the desperation movement, 10 years strong.\n\nOn April 10th, 2012, Dband released the critically acclaimed Center Of It All, a studio worship album produced by Paul Mabury (Hillsong, All Sons and Daughters). This was the bands first experience with an outside producer. 12 brand new songs, most of which were collaborations with writers Jason Ingram, Paul Mabury, Mia Fieldes, Kari Jobe and others. Center Of It All highlights the growth of this New Life Church based worship team. “As we’ve matured and simply gotten older, we’ve found that we come alive most while leading the church at large. All ages. Multi-generational. Though we love to lead young people and always will, we have found that the songs that have most impacted our youth are the songs that have most impacted the church. Center Of It All is a collection of songs for the broader church. Not aimed at one age or generation. God is blurring the lines between young and old. We are one. The blessed church is the unified church.” – Jon Egan Songs from Center Of It All include Strong God, All To Him, and Take Me To The River.\n\nDesperation Band was originally formed in 2001, when New Life youth pastor David Perkins launched a youth movement for local churches called Desperation. They hold multiple Desperation Conferences every summer in Colorado Springs. The Conferences draw thousands of high school and college students who are desperate for the greater things of God. The emphasis of the conference is wrapped up in “The Vow,” a commitment to PASSION, INTERCESSION, CONSECRATION, AND MISSION. Over 30,000 young people have signed the vow and the stories continue to pour in about the difference they are making in their world.\n\nMade up of several committed musicians, the band often travels to conferences, churches, festivals, and concerts throughout the world. They are best known for writing songs like “I Am Free”, “My Savior Lives”, “Amazed”, “Here In Your Presence”, “You Hold It All’, “Yahweh”, and “Overcome.” Several of these songs have been covered by mainstream Christian bands and many songs are sung in churches throughout America and around the world.\n\nDesperation Band has recently partnered with David Todd from 709 Agency. David’s management and direction has brought a new level to Dband as they have done their best to steward what God is doing. Always working as an in-house operation, drummer Jared Henderson carries the load of Dband’s web presence through video blogs, episodes, and social media. Jon Egan creates and implements the graphic design/brand for the team. Production head Cory Reynolds (www.contrastmedia.cc) has directed and edited much of the video content around the band.\n\nJon and the Desperation Band co-founded “Heartwork”, a ministry to the youth of the world that empowers them to be hope and freedom to the orphans of the world. Starting June of 2010, Heartwork launched “the 1k Campaign”…1,000 orphan projects built by 1,000 student groups in 1,000 days. Student groups all over the country formed groups and adopted projects.  The 1,000 days just closed and the effort yielded 1,036 projects fully funded.  \n\nThe Desperation Band has always been more of a ministry than a band. \nJon and the guys believe that true change comes when people lay aside their agendas to encounter the true and living God. They are passionate about the presence of God and they don’t hide it. They are well aware that music will never impact souls…only the power of God. They don’t perform or entertain. They want to join with real people to worship a real God. The Desperation Band exists to partner with His Kingdom and to pray as Jesus told us… “Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”\n\n“We ourselves feel that what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But the ocean would be less because of that missing drop.” -Mother Teresa\n\n“This I know. We will command life from dead places. We will bring light to the darkness. We will prophecy into the void. We will draw near to our Father and invite everyone to come along. We will hear His heart for others. We will answer with movement. With action. We will pray. Then move. Then pray. Then move. We will risk. We will look like fools, we will look good, and everything in between. We will find our identity in Him. We will walk with a limp because we wrestled with God. We will heal those limping while we ourselves limp. We will be ourselves. As for the world changing…we’re gonna join with many others, stay committed to doing our part, and see God reign.” -Jon Egan\n","booking_agent":"booking@709agency.com","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150721353919727","source":"http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/540254_10150721353919727_551250214_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Colorado

و از آن بهره مند شوم .\nپس از انتخاب اثر باید مقدمه ای برای آن در نظر گرفته و جواب های بین کلام ها را بسازم و در نهایت موسیقی انتهایی که پایان بخشِ اثر بود .\nبعد از ملودی پردازی نوبت به تنظیم و ارکستراسیون می رسید که خود داستان مفصلی بود ؛ چرا که  هر قدر ساخت ملودی و ملودی پردازی ها به خوبی صورت می پذیرفت ، اگر تنظیم و ارکستراسیون   با دقت انجام نمی گرفت کلیت کار خدشه دار می گشت .\nمشکل دیگری که در طی مسیربس دشوار می نمود ، رسیدن به بافت و لهجه ی موسیقایی آن قومیت بود که من به عنوان یک آهنگساز و با سابقه ی کاریِ صرفاً در زمینه ی موسیقی ایرانی می بایستی آگاهانه با آن برخورد می نمودم که مبادا ملودی ها و لهجه ی تنظیم قطعات ، شکل و ظاهری ایرانی به خود گرفته باشد . به عنوان مثال در مراحل ساخت و تنظیم قطعات یونانی ، ترکی ، عربی ، ارمنی ، رومانیایی و ... این آگاهی می بایست دو چندان می نمود تا لهجه ی ملودی های ساخته شده و همچنین تنظیم آنها ، رنگ و لعابی ایرانی به خود نگیرد . زیرا بیوگرافی کاریِ من به عنوان آهنگساز ، تاکنون محدود به موسیقی ایرانی بوده و اکنون باید پا فراتر گذارده و مرزهای موسیقایی خود را درنوردم . چرا که اعضای مدیان با یک هدفِ واحد گردِ هم آمده اند و آن چیزی نیست جز شکستن مرزها و آشنا کردن و آشتی دادن فرهنگ ها با یکدیگر در قالب زبان و بیان مدیان ؛ زیرا همه با هر ملیتی و زبانی از       یک آنیم . مدیان جز این چیزی در سر نمی پرورد و جز این ، نمی اندیشد .\nباری ؛ از مطلب دور شدیم .....\nنکته ای دیگر که سختی انتخابِ قطعات را از میان آرشیو شنیداریِ گسترده ، صد چندان می نمود این بود که چون در روند انتخاب اثر پس از شنیدن قطعات آرشیو ، تعداد زیادی از قطعات ، مطلوبِ نظر        می گشت ولی با در نظر گرفتن این مطلب که چون قرار است از هر کشور یک قطعه در آلبوم       جای گیرد و قطعات انتخاب شده از کشورهای گوناگون ، می بایست به نوعی با یکدیگر هم خوانی و ارتباطی هر چند کم و اندک داشته باشند ، لذا انتخاب قطعات نیز سخت تر و سخت تر می شد . چرا که در نهایت قطعات انتخاب شده از هر کشور باید در یک آلبومِ واحد قرار گیرد و مخاطب نباید پس از شنیدن قطعاتی از کشورهای گوناگون – یکی پس از دیگری – دچار حسِ عدمِ ارتباط ، بین هر یک    از آنها گردد .\nحتی اعتراف می نمایم که برخی از این قطعات در اصل هیچ ارتباطی با یکدیگر نداشتند و این وظیفه ی من بود که با تنظیم و ملودی پردازیم این بیگانگی و عدمِ ارتباط را جبران نموده و تلاش کنم که اثری یکدست و یکپارچه بیافرینم .\nپس از تمامی این مراحل ( انتخاب اثر ، آهنگسازی ، تنظیم و ارکستراسیون ) نوبت به اجرای اثررسید .\nهمه ی قطعات ، قبل از ضبط توسط گروه تمرین می شد و از آنجا که لهجه ی اجرایی هر قطعه با     قطعه ی دیگر تفاوت داشت ( با در نظر گرفتن این مطلب که هر کدام از قطعات ، متعلق به یک کشور و فرهنگ و قومیت می باشد ) ، می بایستی با هر کدام از نوازنده ها به طور جداگانه و در آخر به صورت گروهی تمرین می کردم تا مبادا خطِ سیرِ کار از جهت صحیح و درست خود منحرف گردد که صبر و شکیبایی نوازندگان اثر در انجام این مهم ، انکار ناپذیر است .\nبالاخره پس از تمرینات مداوم و طولانی اقدام به ضبط اثر نمودیم . ضبط کار با دقت و وسواسی چندین برابر صورت گرفت که بی حضور سحر ابراهیم و پیگیری و دقتِ نظرِ دلسوزانه اش امکان پذیر نبود .\nچون تمامی قطعات با کلام هستند و اجرای درست و صحیح اشعار ، مستلزمِ شناخت ادبیات و زبان آن کشور (در حد لزوم و نیاز ) بود ، لذا جهت آشنایی هر چه بیشتر و نظارت بر اجرای صحیح اشعار و لهجه ی خوانندگان ، احتیاج به شخصی بود که بتواند این نیازها را مرتفع نموده و به زبان و ادبیاتِ کشور مورد نظر ، مسلط باشد . جهت انجام این امر به سفارتِ هر یک از این کشورها در ایران رجوع کردیم و از هر سفارت ، یک نفر به عنوان نماینده در تمامی جلسات تمرین و ضبط حاضر میشد   تا بر بیان و لهجه ی خوانندگان نظارت داشته باشد که باز زحمات و همیاری های سحر ابراهیم در این مورد نیز ستودنی است و به جرات می توان گفت که بی حضورش این امر ناممکن می نمود .\nدر مراحل ضبطِ خوانندگانِ اثر ، نسخه ی نهایی می بایست به تایید سه نفر می رسید :\nاول : فردِ ناظر بر لهجه و زبان که از سفارتِ کشور مورد نظر بود .\nدوم : سحر ابراهیم به عنوان ناظر ضبط که آهنگِ کلام را از دقت نظرش می گذرانید .\nسوم : من که می بایستی نظر نهایی را می دادم .\nلذا دقت و حوصله ی خوانندگانِ اثر در این امر جای بسی تشویق و احترام دارد .\nمسئله ی دیگر ، حضورِ سعید بنازاده بود که بی همیاری و همراهیش از ابتدا تا کنون کار سرانجام    نمی گرفت و در تمامی مراحل پشتیبانمان بود و همچنین سهیل بنایی که وجودش غنیمت است و    دوستی اش پایدار .\nدر پایان ، ذکر این نکته خالی از لطف نیست که به لطفِ حضورِ تک تکِ اعضای گروه ، در وهله ی اول به سبب دوستی و مهر و صبرشان و در وهله ی دوم توانایی شان در اجرای هر چه بهتر قطعات ،     آلبوم \" دوره گرد \" به پایان رسید و آماده ی انتشار شد .\nبه گرمی دستشان را می فشارم و قدردانِ زحماتشان هستم .\n\n                                                                          هومن مهدویان – پاییز 1391\n         \n     \n  \n","general_manager":"Soheil Banaee","genre":"World

Emerging from Cleveland, Ohio, the group's biggest hit songs include the Grammy Award-winning \"Let It Whip\" (1982), \"Joystick\" (1983), and \"Let It All Blow\" (1984). The name of the band is a portmanteau of the description \"danceable jazz\".HistoryThe Dazz Band, formed in 1976, grew out of the Cleveland, Ohio, jazz fusion band Bell Telefunk, composed of Bobby Harris,founder Sonny Jones lead guitarist/songwriter Mike Calhoun, percussionist Kenny Pettus, drummer Isaac \"Ike\" Wiley, Jr., and his brother bassist Michael Wiley, and the band Mother Braintree. The group became known as Kinsman Dazz, named after both the street and the lounge where they worked as the house band: Sonny Jones' Kinsman Grill Lounge. The group adopted its name before the song \"Dazz\" became an R&B hit for Atlanta's Brick in 1976.Kinsman Dazz was signed to 20th Century Records by Joe Lewis in 1978. The group went to Los Angeles to record for producer Marvin Gaye. Owing to illness, Gaye had to back out of the duties. Harris requested and got Philip Bailey, the vocalist of Earth, Wind & Fire, to produce the group's first album, Kinsman Dazz. Bailey would co-produce the second album, Dazz, and had a major input into the group's vocal arrangements. They released their first single, \"I Might as Well Forget About Loving You\", in late 1978. \"Catchin' Up on You\" followed in 1979.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":6683,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dazz-Band/109488182404487","name":"Dazz Band","talking_about_count":143,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Ghazi the Band","id":"13791288457","info":{"id":"13791288457","app_id":"0","band_members":"Samir Hamraaz - Vocals\nHash Mushtaq - Vocals / Guitars\nTauseef Ghazi - Vocals / Keyboards / Production","bio":"THE BAND:\t\nAccording to Ghazi the Band listening to their music should feel like you’re on a journey. As you travel from destination to destination the music paints a new landscape. From Trance to Dance and Pop to Hip Hop it’s like a genre hopping extravaganza mastering each impeccably. The most exciting thing about this band is that they constantly experiment with sound. \n\nGhazi the Band has synthesized a signature sound that one can only attempt to label. With a solid history and unwavering dedication, their aural assault continues. From their harmonizing vocals , to the sound synthesis , to the shredding guitars, to the stout rhythms and beats, this band fires on all cylinders. Cylinders that power an engine of intense songs, melodic yet aggressive and are fueled by insightful, soulful lyrics.\n\nHash’s mind blowing solos and Samir's hypnotic vocal transitions melded with Ghazi’s lightening fast sound synthesis, keyboard antics and vocal nuances brings out a new variety in Pakistani Music. Refusing to pay heed to the rules of any particular genre of music, their sound will mesmerize you.\n\nSAMIR:\nSamir is known for his powerful voice, amazing breath control, fine musical sensibility and unwavering grasp of the fundamentals. He represents a subtle fusion of classical musicality and passion that has become a signature sound of Ghazi the Band.Samir has  achieved a balance between traditional musical values and progressive pop to give Ghazi the Band the third dimension it needed.\n\nA Pashtoon from Afghanistan, Urdu is not Samir's spoken language but his passion for Pakistani classical and pip music has allowed him to perform in a language that is not really his. Nothing could articulate his talent and passion for music more.      \n\nGHAZI:\nGhazi first came on the music scene with a band called \"The Vibes\" in 1994. A keyboardist and an avid composer he left the band in 1996 to pursue his own individual aspirations. He moved to Houston, Texas and established an audio production house called \"The Vibes Audio Interactive\". After a brief involvement with \"MAUJ\", Ghazi teamed with Hash and Samir. The trio are working on various projects together including Ghazi the Band’s first studio album “Faraibiyaan”.\n\nGhazi paints an honest picture of himself and the world as he sees it, amidst a truly diverse blend of musical influences, from traditional ethnic melodies to pop, from trance to electronic dance. The result is an incredibly ambitious electronic record. His work strongly advocates his inclination towards trance and a fusion of eastern melodies. The upcoming albums as heard by some have been deemed very progressive. \n\nHis love for electronic music started with pioneers like 80's synth-pop acts like Depeche Mode and Pet Shop Boys, followed up by the early releases from acts like The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. In 1997 he discovered trance & house, and since then he's been a loyal follower of this scene, though in later years his taste has developed more and more towards progressive pop sounds.\n\nGhazi started producing electronic music in 2005, and today he works in the fully equipped Ghazi Studios. Currently on the projects. Ghazi has always held his post, his battle stations: playing the keyboards and keeping the flame of the dance philosophy burning. Over one thousand and one uncertain nights; and now, upon his ascendancy, Ghazi delivers “Ghazi the Band”.\n\nHASH:\nA former keyboardist-turned-guitarist; He was an underground artist that launched his first single \"Faryaad\" in 2003. Hash formed the band Irtiash (Vibrations) in Seattle which consisted of him on acoustic guitars and vocals and Arsalan Bukhari on bass. They performed at various venues from 2003-2005. Their mellow covers and acoustic tunes earned them the spotlight in the music scene. Soon their band expanded with the addition of a session guitarist and drummer. \n\nApart from performing private shows within the city, their major successes included their 1st formal opening gig for Strings in Nov 2003, the Seattle University Battle of the Bands in 2004 in which they won the prestigious 3rd position among many bands, and doing the opening performance for Quadstock, Seattle University's biggest event of the year. They had the honors to open for bands like The Roots from California, Divorce, and many other local bands from Seattle.\n\nHash started shifting gears in his solo career and did side projects mastering his music skills with home recordings and audio production. He departed from the music scene in late 2004, and now he emerges in Houston forming \"Ghazi the Band\" with Tauseef Ghazi to bring their talents together to create music that is entertaining yet challenging, harmonious although complex, and demonstrative of a synergy between the musicians that transcends their individual excellence and musical styles.","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150599387818458","source":"http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/431718_10150599387818458_1989890925_n.jpg","offset_y":28,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Houston","genre":"Electronic","has_added_app":false,"hometown":"Houston","is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":122882,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/ghazimusic","name":"Ghazi the Band","record_label":"Vibes Audio Interactive","talking_about_count":132,"username":"ghazimusic","website":"http://www.ghazionline.com","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Golaço","id":"267128976660537","info":{"id":"267128976660537","app_id":"0","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":386319351408165,"source":"http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s720x720/538845_386319351408165_1443978215_n.jpg","offset_y":21,"offset_x":0},"has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":28284,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/BandaGolaco","name":"Banda Golaço","talking_about_count":125,"username":"BandaGolaco","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Tim Cooper","id":"209547625767994","info":{"id":"209547625767994","about":"Some things in Life aren't Meant for you to Control,,, That Means someone upstairs is Telling you to Just Let it Go.....","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"Alan Jackson,Toby Kieth, George Strait","band_interests":"Having a good Time,,lol","bio":"Tim Cooper and the Midnite Ride have been performing for over ten years.

Aos 12 anos começou a ser instruído em canto (Coral), dança e recebeu as primeiras aulas de Circo, em uma fundação que funcionava no Teatro Marquise Branca, enquanto recebia aulas de interpretação na escola com a professora Zizi Telécio, em Juazeiro do Norte. Com 14 anos foi vocalista em sua primeira banda, a Young’s Crazy, quando começou a apresentar as próprias composições. \n\nAos 16 recebeu também aulas de Teatro no SESC de sua cidade, voltadas ao gênero Musical, no que viria a se tornar sua futura área de estudo. Por cerca de dois anos dedicou-se ao Ensino Médio, quando aos 20 ingressou no Centro de Artes Violeta Arraes Gervaiseau, onde hoje é acadêmico do Curso de Teatro da Universidade Regional do Cariri.\n\nTendo já experiência profissional com o palco pela quarta vez em B.O.G.A., como também em E… Que Seja Doce (2012), Geni (2012), e Deu mais Shakespeare (2011), nunca afastou-se da música, e esse ano faz seu primeiro trabalho profissional no ramo com a gravação da faixa “Mundo Perdido”, compostas letra e melodia pelo David, e com arranjos e produção de Marcelo Rolim.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":false,"is_published":true,"likes":7439,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/davidbandeiramusic","name":"David Bandeira","talking_about_count":84,"username":"davidbandeiramusic","website":"www.davidbandeira.tnb.art.br/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Banda Camafeu","id":"175096499249738","info":{"id":"175096499249738","about":"Esta é a pagina da Banda Camafeu!

The band’s first line-up also included bassist Gary Fletcher, guitarist Tom McGuinness (also of Manfred Mann) and drummer Hughie Flint, (the two had previously formed McGuinness Flint). In 1982 Flint left and was replaced by former Family drummer Rob Townsend.HistoryTheir first album The Official Blues Band Bootleg Album, a mixture of blues standards and original songs featured the Jones and McGuinness composition \"Come On In\" and their long-standing stage favourite \"Flatfoot Sam\". This album initially attracted no interest from major record companies, so the band pressed a limited run of 3,000, hand-stamped their logo on the cardboard sleeve and signed them all. After unqualified endorsement from BBC Radio 1 presenter Simon Bates and others, media interest resulted in a recording contract with Arista Records, who re-released the album under the same title. After that they released Ready, Itchy Feet and Brand Loyalty albums and regularly toured through Europe.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":7412,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Blues-Band/106328979398739","name":"The Blues Band","talking_about_count":80,"were_here_count":0}},{"name":"\"Chakra\" The Band","id":"117538351716192","info":{"id":"117538351716192","about":"Music","app_id":"0","artists_we_like":"http://chakratheband.com","band_interests":"http://chakratheband.com","band_members":"Yatin gadgil- Keybords, guitars, melodica,harmonica, composition, arranger, PRODUCER\nSalil Gupte - Drums, duff, dimdi, chanda, dhol etc and OPERATIONS HEAD \nTejas Shinde - Vocals/composer\nThigale - Bass Guitars\nDips - Lead Guitars\nNitin Pawar -  Keyboards\n","bio":"http://chakratheband.com","booking_agent":"info@chakratheband.com  Ph. 09970004052","can_post":false,"category":"Musician/band","checkins":0,"cover":{"cover_id":275028099300549,"source":"http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/941218_275028099300549_1224583652_n.jpg","offset_y":16,"offset_x":0},"current_location":"Pune","description":"Albert Einstein said \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.

The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, Champion Versions, they added Robin Jones (drums) and John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards). Steve Duffield was the original bassist but quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and decided to quit the band. He would later produce recordings under the name Lone Pigeon.

De acordo com a mesma fonte, a primeira saída para fora do concelho de Baião acontece em 1921, já com outro regente, e em 30 de Abril de 1924, por ocasião da inauguração do coreto da freguesia, as crónicas diziam “...escuta-se agradavelmente e promete ajustar mais um florão à nobre divisa da nossa terra” (in Jornal “Flor do Zêzere”). Da Banda Zezerense perde-se então o rasto; pensa-se, por alguns relatos mais antigos, que tenha estado inactiva por alguns anos.\n\nApós a fundação da “Casa do Povo de Santa Marinha do Zêzere” (1937), reaparece sob a designação de “Banda Musical da Casa do Povo de Santa Marinha do Zêzere”, nome com que chega à actualidade, sem que haja conhecimento de qualquer interregno na sua actividade.\n\nMuitos foram os regentes e os músicos que deram o seu contributo para que esta Banda se afirmasse como uma das mais importantes da região e fosse solicitada para as romarias mais importantes da região norte, com especial destaque para a região de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, no final do século passado.\n\nNas décadas de 80 e 90 do século XX houve uma primeira onda de rejuvenescimento, que continua a verificar-se num processo de substituição natural. Em resultado deste processo, o conjunto de executantes actual apresenta uma média de idades bastante baixa, muito embora um elevado número de elementos possua mais de 15 anos de experiencia. Na sua composição actual, todos os músicos são naturais do concelho de Baião, sendo que mais de 90% foram formados na escola de música da própria Associação.\n\nEm Janeiro de 2002, com a tomada de posse de uma Direcção jovem com origem na propria Banda, iniciou uma nova fase do seu longo historial. Em Julho de 2004, foi reformulada a imagem da Associação com a adopção de um novo fardamento, com a criação de um símbolo próprio e de uma bandeira que passou a integrar e enriquecer os desfiles em que esta Banda participa.\n\nDesde Outubro de 2006 tem como director Artístico Hermínio Fonseca, natural e residente no concelho de Baião, músico da Banda da Regiao Militar do

After showing the tapes to some industry people, he was told that if he formed a band that sounded like the tapes, he could get a record deal. Laner then assembled a band of musicians from the L.A. music scene. Medicine's early lineup included Laner, drummer Jim Goodall, guitarist Jim Putnam, bassist Eddie Ruscha, and singer Annette Zilinskas, an original member of The Bangles. Putnam, Ruscha, and Zilinskas eventually left; the latter was replaced by former Fourwaycross singer Beth Thompson. On the basis of the original demo, the band got signed to Creation Records, becoming the first American band to do so. In America Medicine signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings label in 1992.

This album was released on Thirty Days Of Night record label, which they have since left.Their This is England tour with Co-Headliners Lower Than Atlantis took TRC to new venues all across the UK over a 30 day period.

Their debut album Trees Dream in Algebra was nominated for the 2010 Choice Music Prize. The band have established themselves swiftly as a very exciting and energetic live act and to date have supported such bands as Keane and The Airborne Toxic Event.HistoryFormationCodes formed in late 2007 when all members – who had been friends for several years - found themselves available to compose and play music together. Previously, Daragh and former member Paul Reilly had played in another group that disbanded, while Raymond – who had just recently moved to Dublin – also left a band that he was involved with.Debut album (2008 - 2010)In early 2008 they released 2 independent singles –\"This is Goodbye\" and \"Guided by Ghosts\", that both entered the Irish top 50 at number 32 and number 43 respectively. Both singles were well received critically, helped towards a growing fan base and secured the band their first major shows, including a slot on the IMRO Showcase Tour and the Oxegen music festival in Ireland.In late 2008 the band began to demo songs for their debut album. Not content with waiting for a record label to pick them up they decided to go ahead and record and finance their debut album themselves, resulting in each member taking out a loan to fund the recording. The album was recorded in November 2008 at Modern World Studios in Gloucestershire, UK, with Manic Street Prechers producer Greg Haver.","has_added_app":false,"is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"likes":251,"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Codes-band/106104236086879","name":"Codes (band)","talking_about_count":1,"website":"http://www.codes.ie/","were_here_count":0}},{"name":"Freepeople Band","id":"128429330676072","info":{"id":"128429330676072","about":"Official Page for FreePeople™ Band.
